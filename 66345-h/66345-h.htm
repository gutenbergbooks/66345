    <h3 id="THE_RAT">THE RAT</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">RATS is radiants and the little ones is a mouse, and thats the feller
    which pursues the women folks up into a high tree and blankets on her
    blood! But the old he rat eats bread and cheese like a thing of life.</p>

  <p>One day my mother she baited a trap with Dutch cheese, for to catch
    a rat. My father he looked on a while, and then he said, my father
    did: “I guess there isnt any doubt about the rat finding that deadly
    invention if he follers his nose, and I foresee his finish, but what is
    the trap for?”</p>

  <p>Rats is two kinds, the common and the mush. The common is the scourge
    of the world, but the mush he lives in the water and is highly
    respected. The fur of the mush is a article of commerce and keeps your
    hands warm when winter stalks abroad like a devouring kangaroon. If
    I was a mush I would keep my fur for my own self and say: “You fool
    humans can stay in the house and stand by the fire.” But Uncle Ned he
    says that would be bad for athletical sports, why not let them go out
    of doors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> but keep their hands in one a others pockets as usual?</p>

  <p>He says one time in Arizona there was a show, and the show man he stood
    in the door of his tent and hollored: “Walk up, walk up, ladies and
    gents, and see the fierce Canadian beaver, which is the 8th wonder of
    the world and the anchor of hope to them which is afflicted with the
    dumps. He roams the rivers of the frozen north, from Dan Couvers island
    to Sammy Quoddys bay in the state of Maine, and his voice is ever for
    war. When he throws his eye upon a tree the doom of that monarch of
    the forest primeval is sealed, its caroar at a end and its name a by
    word in the mouths of men, for he ganaws it down while you wait, and as
    it thunders to earth he raises the song of triump and lashes the air
    to foam! His house is fathoms five under the glad waters of the deep
    blue sea, and the steam boats pass above him as he pursues the evil
    tenor of his way, in maiden meditation, fancy free. At midnights holy
    hour he arises to the surface for to communicate with his kindreds in
    a far country, and the slap of his powerful tail is heard around the
    world. The dams which he builds with his teeths and feets turns aside
    the Father of Waters, and mighty cities are with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> eternal past! Yet
    this wonder worker is endowered with a domestical mind and a sociable
    dispusition, and he is never so happy as when surounded by such
    friendly and congenual spirits as I see before me, generously eager for
    to cheer him in his campaign of education. Walk up, walk up, only fifty
    cents for to bring the balm of Gulliad to this lonely exiles heart.”</p>

  <p>I asked Uncle Ned was it a mush rat, and he said, Uncle Ned did: “I
    dont know, Johnny, I dont know. I hadnt time to go in and cheer up the
    lonely exile, for having the misfortune to wear a stopipe hat and look
    like maybe I would steal horses, I feared that if I went in the show I
    might be too much absorbed in admiration to the beaver to mark the laps
    of time, and would be late at the boundry.”</p>

  <p>Beavers is mammals, but the mush is amfabulous and lays eggs. And thats
    why I say every feller to his own taste and the tiger for us all.</p>

  <p>The mush he lives in the river, and when he is attempted to be caught
    he swims across and whisks his tail, real contemptible, much as to say:
    “No you dont.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

  <p>But if you have a gun you do.</p>

  <p>Injins eats the mush every little tiny bit up, fur and all, and, then
    the white man he says: “You uncivilize galoot, aint you a shamed of
    yourself for to be so filthy, why dont you eat oysters, like you was
    folks?”</p>

  <p>But, if I was Injins I wouldnt care what I et, just so it was pizen.
    Franky, thats the baby, he eats everything which is in the world and is
    made sick. One time Mary, thats the house maid, she come to my mother
    ablubberin like she had been licked, and she said, Mary did: “O, if you
    please, mum, I gave Franky his fathers pocket knife for to play with,
    and Ime afraid he will make a improper use of it.”</p>

  <p>Mother she said: “Go and take it away from him this minute!”</p>

  <p>But Mary she only just cried harder and said: “He won’t give it up, for
    he has swollered it.”</p>

  <p>Girls is fools, but Billy, thats my brother, he can stand on his head,
    and Jack Brily, which is the wicked sailor, he can climb the mast and
    fling defiance into the teeths of the storm!</p>

  <p>Jack says one time a other sailor hired out as mate of a ship which the
    captain of had a pet kangaroon. One day fore the ship sailed the mate
    was lyin in his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>bunk, and the kang it come in and looked around the
    room, but the mate he let on for to be asleep. So the kang it stole a
    shirt and stuffed it in the pouch on the stomach of its belly. Then it
    took a comb and a hair brush and put them in too. Bime by it see the
    mate’s new shoes, and his toothbrush and a railroad guide and took them
    all. Then the roon it hopped away.</p>

  <p>The mate he got up and went to the captain and sed, the mate did: “If
    you are willing, sir, Ide like to be set ashore to once, cause we are
    doomed for to sink in the bowel of the sea.”</p>

  <p>The captain said how did he know, and the mate said: “By a infaluble
    sign. I seen that big French rat of yourn a packin up for to forsake
    the ship.”</p>

  <p>Rats is every where, but the kang is a native of Illinoy and leaps from
    crag to crag!</p>

  <p>My sisters young man he says the women has rats in their hair, so you
    better keep away from them, but my sister says why dont he?</p>

  <p>When he comes to see her he asks how I am gettin on with my natural
    histry, and then he tells me things which I am welcome for to put into
    it, but she says what a fib, and I must not believe a word which he
    says, and looks right in his eyes with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>hern, real reproachy, but he
    isnt a bit afraid. Hern are brown, but hisn is gray.</p>

  <p>Rats is bipeds, but the hi potamus has got hair on its teeths and can
    swoller a native nigger like he was a capsule. And that is why I say do
    into others the same as you would be done to by them your own self.</p>

    <h3 id="BUTTYGOATS">BUTTYGOATS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THERE is billygoats and nannygoats and they are all butty if you dont
    look out, for when they are made fun of they will act in the most
    responsible manner.</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he says one time there was a little boy which was a havin his
    own fun with a goat, by gettin down on his all 4s and stampin his hands
    and shakin his head like it was the goat’s head, but the goat it didnt
    seem for to mind, but went round behind him, like it said: “I wont have
    nothing to do with this business.”</p>

  <p>But when it got to where it wanted to be it let drive, real cruel,
    where the boy sat down. The boy he lit in the open door of a house,
    and a old man come out and saw the boy, and then he looked all around,
    but didnt see nobody else, and then he looked up to the sky and said:
    “Heaven be praised, which has sent us a son!”</p>

  <p>But I guess he knew.</p>

  <p>The Bible it says for to be frightful and multiply.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

  <p>When he was movin out of the other house into this one, Billy, thats
    my brother, had took a big lookin glass to the wagon and stood it up
    against a wheel, and a goat he see himself in the glass, and that was
    more than he would stand, so he backed off and took a run and jump with
    his head down, like it was a cow catcher on a engine. The glass it was
    smashed, but the goat was catched between the spokes of the wheel and
    held fast a long time. When he got out he run round to the other side
    of the wagon and viewed the land scape oer, and shook his head mighty
    brave, like saying: “Well, you got away this time, you ugly feller, but
    you wouldnt if it hadnt been for that wagon in the way, and you better
    not let me see you in this part of the country again, mister!”</p>

  <p>Goats is mollusks, but the centipede is infantry. The pede is found in
    the torpid zone, but the rhi nupple dinkey is a three legger and makes
    the welkin ring! Jack Brily, which is the wicked sailor, swears and
    chews tobacco, and every thing, says the dink is the gem of the ocean
    and can swaller 2 men to once. One day Jack seen a dink a follering the
    ship which he worked on, and he told the captain. The captain he said:
    “That is mighty mournful, cause the dinky is bad luck unless he is fed
    a sailor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> every day. We are 6 days from the port where we are bound
    for, and there is just seven of us. The way I figure it out I shall
    have to take this ship into port pretty short handed. Go forwerd and
    unship the cook.”</p>

  <p>Jack he said: “I, I, sir,” and went and flang the cook over board and
    the dink et the cook.</p>

  <p>Next day the captain made Jack thro over the mate, and next day the
    carpenter, and the dink et both. Jack he begun for to be mighty
    nervous, but on the 4th day, as he was about to heave a able bodied
    seaman into the ragin deeps, they sighted a wreck and rescued the crew.
    That enabled them for to give the dink 2 men a day and save 4 human
    lifes.</p>

  <p>Billy says there isnt any such thing as a rhi nupple dinky, but Jack he
    says Billy is prejudiced cause Jacks father is nothing only but just a
    humble butcher, but ourn wears a stopipe hat.</p>

  <p>Jack says he pines like a caged eagle on this dull, unchangin shore,
    but my sisters young man he says that the briny deep which Jack knows
    most about is his fathers barrel of pickled pork. But I know Jack was
    one time a pirate, for his arm is tattered red and blue with a picture
    of a angel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> and a labm.</p>

  <p>Jakey Epstein, which is the curly headed Jew, he says pork is pizen,
    and one day when my sisters young man was eatin a sausage Jakey’s
    father he spoke up and sed: “I rather die than eat that.”</p>

  <p>My sisters young man stopt eatin awhile, and looked at him sollem out
    of his eyes, and bime by he said: “Ide rather you would.”</p>

  <p>But it is wicked to sass back, for the Bible it says a soft answer
    turneth away rats.</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he said: “Johnny, did I ever tell you about the buttigoat
    which had never saw a mule? One day it saw one a standin in the sun,
    like it was asleep. The butty it looked awhile and then it walked
    around to the last part of the mule, a lookin mighty sly, much as to
    say: 'When he cant see me I’ll sock it to him good and plenty.’</p>

  <p>“But the mule knew what was doing, and when the butty tried to sock it
    to him he kicked him in the forehead real cruel, and the butty turned a
    flip flop and lit on his back with his feets in the air. Bime by he got
    up and shook his self, and stomped the ground, and looked at the mule a
    long time, which was a chewin his cud real peaceful. After a while the
    butty he said to his self: 'Ide like for to know which end that feller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
    buts with. I know which I do by the ache.’”</p>

  <p>The horse is the noblest animal which scours the plain, but the
    buttigoat can knock out a dog like the dog hadnt been there, for the
    butty was give dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the birds of
    the foul air and everything that is born of woman.</p>

    <h3 id="CATS">CATS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">A FELLER which had took a unfurnished bed room in a lodgin’ house, he
    said one evening to a friend which had called on him: “Now I got my
    room, and I have bought this bed and chair, but my money has give out,
    wot am I to do for a water pitcher, and a lamp, and a hair brush, and
    other little articles of luxury such as a man of refined taste likes to
    see about him?”</p>

  <p>Then his friend he spoke up and said: “Just give me that old cat and
    come along o me, and we will get all them things mighty quick.”</p>

  <p>So they took the cat into the back yard of a other house and pinned her
    tail to a cloes line, where she swung free to the sport of the wind and
    owled awful! Then the fellers friend he said: “Now we will get plenty
    water jugs, and lamps, and hair brushes, and old shoes, and all things
    which is nice. All we got to do is just hide ourselfs till they come
    down like manna from Heaven.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

  <p>They stayed all night till the cat had singed herself into the better
    land and they was most froze, and no manna. While they was a lookin up
    to a window a feller in his night shirt opened the window and looked
    out for to see the sun rise. Then one of them said to the shirt feller:
    “It is a nice mornin, gum dast you!” But the man at the window he didnt
    say nothing. So the other feller he hollered: “How do you like music,
    old stick-in-the-mud?” but the man didn’t say nothin a other time. Then
    the feller which the cat was hisn he shook his two fists real terible
    and hollered: “Ile get even on you for this, you darned thief!”</p>

  <p>The man in the house took notice and went away from the window, but
    pretty soon come back with a enormous ear trumpet, which he stuck in
    his ear and leaned out and shouted: “What?”</p>

  <p>Old Gaffer Peters, which has got the bald head, he had a big Maltese
    cat, and the cat had a hole in its ear. One day it come in to Mister
    Brilys meat shop, which is the fat butcher, and Jack Brily, he catched
    it and shut it up. But first he cut off its ear which had the hole in
    it. Bime by Missis Doppy, which is old Gaffer’s daughter and has a red
    head, she come in for to buy sausage meat. Jack he sneaked the cat ear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
    into the sausage meat and Missis Doppy she took the meat home, but Jack
    he said, just as she left the shop:</p>

  <p>“That is the dandiest sausage meat which we have ever made, you look at
    it when you get home, and see if it aint.”</p>

  <p>When she was gone Jack he shut the cat up in the box which catches the
    ground up meat as it comes out of the machine, and waited. Pretty soon
    Missis Doppy she come boilin in, real furious, and handed back the meat
    and showed Jack the cat ear with the hole in it and said: “Young man,
    do you know what that is?”</p>

  <p>Jack he looked at it a long time, and then he said: “Looks like it
    might maybe be a washer off of some kind of machine. Where did you get it?”</p>

  <p>Missis Doppy said: “I got it out of that meat. You made our cat in to
    sausage, you wicked thief!”</p>

  <p>Just then old Mister Brily come in and asked what was up, and while
    Missis Doppy was a weepin and sayin what a mean man he was Jack said:
    “I dont see how that cat could get in the machine without our guilty
    knowledge, lets see if we can find the other ear.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

  <p>So he flang open the box of the grinder and the cat jumped out, and
    made a dash for the door and most knocked Missis Doppy down and busted
    out of the shop like it was a whirl wind, and scampered up the street,
    toward home, you never have see such a circus! Missis Doppy she fainted
    dead away and Mister Brily he hurled a beef bone at Jack, which dodged
    and walked away, a singin about war with its wide dissolution.</p>

  <p>But Mister Pitchel, thats the preacher, he says it is wicked for to
    poke fun at the women, cause they cant poke back. Mister Pitchel he can
    pray real fine, but if me and Billy was preachers I rather be a pirate
    like Rinard the Red Revenger, which declaimed war with the whole world
    and had ships and a castle and no goin to school.</p>

  <p>When cats is roarin like distant thunder it makes a feller awful fraid
    unless he is a sleepin with his sister.</p>

  <p>The pig it is a native of the Holy Land, and dogs is French, but
    cats is known from the earliest times and can pur. Missis Dumberly,
    which has eleven children, she was to our house, and she said, Missis
    Dumberly did, that she just couldn’t bear cats. Then Uncle Ned he spoke
    up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> and said: “That is mighty lucky for the mice.”</p>

  <p>Missy, thats my sister, she doesnt like cats too, but girls is
    quadderpeds and cant climb trees, and when they are mad they spit and
    swear and hunch their backs up like they was camomiles.</p>

  <p>Cats and taggers is the same thing, only the tagger he is bigger and
    can thrash the lion, and is the king of the jingle. If I was a tag
    Ide rather be a rhi nosey rose, for the rhi it has got a sticker, and
    when it fights the ephalent it jabs its sticker in to the stomach of
    the ephs belly. And that is why the cracky dile says: “Suffer little
    children to come into me.”</p>

  <p>Ephalents was one time used in battle, but once when the king of Rome
    was a chargin with ten thousand hundred ephs the enemies they turned
    loose a ton of rats, and the ephs all fled amain as one man! The king
    of Romes neck was broke and ephalents have ever since pursued the arts
    of peace and eats pea nuts. Mister Jonnice, which has the wood laig, he
    was one time a soldier in the war, and thats the way he got it, cause
    the enemies they shot it off with cannons for to keep him from runnin
    away. But he says he done some mighty good hoppin.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

  <p>Mose, which is the cat, and Bildad, thats the new dog, they are good
    friends, but when Mose is give a saucer of milk Bildad he jumps in and
    swallers it in 3 or 4 gulps. Then he looks around at Mose, like he was
    astonished, and shakes his head, much as to say: “Well, well, if I had
    knew there wasnt no milk in that saucer I wouldnt have took the trouble
    for to come and see.”</p>

  <p>Bildad has got a bushy tail, and Mose he can blow hisn up like a
    balloon wen he is mad, but the Manx cat it hasnt got any. And that
    proves that all is for the best, cause man was made in six days and
    rested on the 7th and went a fishin.</p>

  <p>When cats fight they spit fire and sword! One night 2 tom cats was
    fightin and a woman she put her head out of the window and said to a
    police man: “Poor things, why dont you part them, you wicked man?”</p>

  <p>The police man he spoke up and said, the police man did: “I thought of
    that, mum, but I guess it aint worth while, cause it looks to me like
    they would part one a other.”</p>

  <p>I think he was afraid, but it is nice for to be brave like Billy, which
    says if there wasnt any soldiers the Millennium would be upon to us and
    we would all have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> to flee to the mountains!</p>

  <p>My sisters young man says that once there was a cat, and there was a
    dog, and there was a lamb, and there was a ox. The dog it said to the
    ox: “Thats a mighty long tail you got there, mister, with a nice duster
    to the end of it, but you cant waggle it when you meet your master
    carryin a beef steak.”</p>

  <p>Then the cat it said to the ox, too: “No, indeed, and you cant blow it
    up and spit fire wen you meet a other ox.”</p>

  <p>The lamb it said: “And you aint able for to twinkle it when you think
    of some thing funny.”</p>

  <p>The ox he thought awhile and then he said: “I played hookey when I was
    a little boy so much that I didn’t learn them vain acomplishments,
    thats a fact, but I have got a tolerbly fair business education, and I
    guess maybe you fellers would have to come to me for to help you out if
    you had to fill a order for ox tail soup.”</p>

  <p>Mary, thats the house maid, she has wrote some poetry about cats, which
    my mother says is mighty fine. Here it is: </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

        <div class="i2">But beware its toe nail!</div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">There is nothing beautifuller than cats</div>
        <div class="i2">When they are little kits,</div>

        <div class="i2">And maybe poison Billy and Johnny.</div>
      </div>

  </div>

  <p>I never have saw such rot, but Uncle Ned he says: “I beg for to remind
    you, fair youth, that you have yet to peruse the work of Ella Wheeler
    Wilcox.”</p>

  <p>If I was a poet I would not write about spitcats, no, indeed, it would
    be all about the eagle, which is the king of beasts and fixes its eye
    on to the sun, and soars aloof into the blue imperial, and defies the
    lion and her welps!</p>

  <p>Once there was a eagle which was a show, and a man which was to the
    show dropped a twenty dollar gold piece and it rolled into the eagles
    cage. The eagle it looked at it a while, and called his wife and said,
    the eag did: “That feller threw his poker check in here, and I guess he
    thought I would swaller it cause it has a chicken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> on one side, but Ide
    blush for to have such a nasty lookin rooster cut out of my craw.”</p>

  <p>My sisters young man he says when he was a boy and went to school him
    and a other boy had a readin lesson about animals. The teacher, which
    was near sighted, he had lost his spettacles and couldn’t tell one word
    from a other, and they knew it. So when they stood up for to read, my
    sisters young man he begun and said: “The cat is the loftiest centipede
    which sweeps the horizon and scowers the plain.”</p>

  <p>The teacher he said: “What’s that, whats that?”</p>

  <p>Then my sisters young man he looked at the book, real atentive and said
    it again. The teacher he said: “Lemmy see that book, youngster, just
    lemmy see it.”</p>

  <p>When he got the book he poked his long nose in it and pretended for to
    read, and then he scratched his head where it didn’t itch and told the
    other boy to go on and read too. The other boy he looked at the book
    and said, like he was readin: “The cat is found in every country of the
    globe, but it likes republics the best, and when it soars aloft the
    nations of the earth tremble so that you can see them shake.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

  <p>The teacher looked at the book a other time, close to, but bime by he
    give it back and said, the teacher did: “Young men, that readin lesson
    looks to the yuman eye jest like it has looked for twenty years, but I
    guess I have got to get some spettacles for my ears.”</p>

  <p>But the ears of the jackus are a spettacle their selves, for the jack
    he is a bird of bray.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">I&nbsp;ASKED Uncle Ned what makes the crane stand on one foot for to
    sleep, and he spoke up and said: “Johnny, you have opened the door of
    optunity to my waitin soul and I will come out into the light and make
    everything clear.</p>

  <p>“One day in the Garden of Eden Adam he see a lot of animals playin.
    There was all your old friends, the ephalent, the lion, the tagger,
    the hi potamus, the giraft, the kangaroon, the rhi naughty furious and
    some of the little fellers. Adam he looked on a while, real sad, for
    he knew, Adam did, that some day they would be tearin one a other to
    rags and sheddin gore excessive, such being the ordained consquences of
    his own sins. Bime by he flang away his gloomy reflections and said:
    'You fellers is mighty playful, but you are terible clumsy. I bet there
    isn’t one of you which can stand on one laig.’</p>

  <p>“They all tried, but they fell every time. Then the crane, which was
    a standin by a pond a little way off, talkin to a frog, he tossed his
    bill up, real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> contemptible, and strutted in to their midst, and liftin
    up one leg stood on the other like a statute.</p>

  <p>“Adam he looked a while and then he said: 'Impudence is the king of
    badfulness. The athletical test which I proposed was for quadpeds, and
    any gam doodled creepin thing which butts in takes his life in his
    hand, for I am give dominion over all the beasts of the field, and all
    the fishes of the sea, and all the birds of the foul air, and every
    thing which was made in 6 days.’</p>

  <p>“The crane tossed his head scornful and said: 'We have had all that
    before; give us a rest.’</p>

  <p>“Adam he said: 'Motion is the mother of fatigue. You jest stand like
    you are till tomorrow morning and maybe you will be rested.’</p>

  <p>“So the crane he had to do it, and it made him so tired out that to
    this day he sleeps frequent, and he always has to do it on one laig.
    And that ought to teach little boys for to not butt in.”</p>

  <p>When Uncle Ned had told me a bout the crane I asked him did he know
    what makes the loon laugh.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

  <p>He said: “Yes, indeed, Ime jest the feller which can whack up the
    desired infmation, to the queens taste. Most peoples they think it
    is because he has a comical disposition, but they are mistook, for
    generally speakin he is the solemest aquatical bird which sails the
    seas over, but he is cursed with a fatal memory.</p>

  <p>“One time, a little while after the world was made, Adam and Eve was
    a sittin by the side of a lake, and there was a loon hid in the reeds
    which grew in the water. Adam he held Eves hand, and stroked it, and
    patted her on the shoulder, and ran his fingers through her hair, and
    done all them things which crazy folks do and sensible fellers like me
    and you dont understand. Bime by Eve she up and said: 'Adam, do you
    love me?’</p>

  <p>“Adam he said, Adam did: 'How couldnt I, when you are the sweetest
    woman in the world?’</p>

  <p>“Eve she smiled real bright, and after a while she said a other time:
    'Forgive me, dearest, if I pain you, but I have been worryin so much
    about some thing. Was you ever in love before?’</p>

  <p>“Adam he look at her real solem out of his eyes, and then he rose his
    right hand up and said: 'No, darling, I swear it, never till I met
    you.’</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

  <p>“Then Eve she snuggled down close to him and murmured: 'O Adam, it
    gives me such joy for to hear you say that!’</p>

  <p>“It give the loon joy too, and his laughture rang out over the waters,
    loud and shrill and echo answered from the hill. And to this day he
    laughs whenever he thinks of the women folks.”</p>

  <p>But if me and Billy had been there we would have ringed the loons neck,
    cause the Bible it says that scoffers shall be casted into Abrahams
    bosom. Loons is mammals, and the walrus is poultry, and cracky diles is
    ally gaters, and the camel is the sheep of the desert and is hunted for
    its plumes. And thats why I say how wonderful is the works of Man!</p>

    <h3 id="THE_SNAKE">THE SNAKE</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE fish is a animal and the bird is a beast, but snakes is a fo to
    man. The snake he is the same as serpents, only he hasnt no feets, and
    that makes him mad and he bites every thing which is in the world.
    Snakes is pizen, but the hog he says: “I dont care, it wont do you any
    good for to bite me.”</p>

  <p>Then the snake he says: “It dont do me no good for to bite any kind of
    feller, that aint why I do it, I aint selfish.”</p>

  <p>So he whacks away at the hog and hollers hooray! But the hog he catches
    him by the middle and makes 2 snakes of him in a minute and says: “I’m
    pretty bitey my self, thank you.”</p>

  <p>Hogs is pork, but Jakey Epstein he says he would rather be one than
    eat one. But give me a sucker nice roasted, with plenty mashed
    potatoes, and apple sauce, and pickles, and hot cakes, and mince pie,
    and walnuts, and you will see a boy which knows his own mind. Hogs is
    bristly, but the ally gater has notches in the spine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> of his back and
    eats niggers.</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned, which has been in Indy and every where, he says the Gangee
    river is over flowin with gaters, and one time he see a gater a lyin
    on the bank asleep, and he told his servant, which was a natif nigger:
    “Take a ax and chop up that dead tree into stove wood,” cause thats
    what Uncle Ned thought it was. The servant he thought so too and said:
    “Yessir,” and Uncle Ned he went away to shoot rabbits in the jingle.
    When he come back he went in the bungaloo and found the servant covered
    up nice and warm in bed. Uncle Ned said: “You lazy feller, did you chop
    up that log, like I told you?”</p>

  <p>The feller he said: “I tried to, sir, but it come to life.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he spoke up, real sarcastical, and said: “O sure, and I
    suppose it put forth some limbs, didnt it?”</p>

  <p>The feller said: “Yessir, it put forth some on each side.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned said a other time: “It blossomed too, maybe.”</p>

  <p>The nigger feller said: “Yessir, bout 3 feet wide, you ought to have
    saw it open like it was a morning glory!”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

  <p>Then Uncle Ned, which was still ironical, he said: “Did it take root?”</p>

  <p>The nigger feller thought a while and then he said: “I was a bit upset
    and can’t recollect that it took any thing only but jest my laig.”</p>

  <p>But if a gater wanted Billys laig he would cut its head off with a long
    sword and say: “That will teach you for to not ask for it, cause I want
    it to go to school with.” Billy is the bravest boy he ever saw, and
    licks Sammy Doppy every little while.</p>

  <p>A other time in Indy Uncle Ned was a walkin in the jingle and a long
    slender snake jumped at him and bit him on the hand and ran away. Then
    Uncle Ned he run as hard as he could for to get home and die in the
    bosom of his club. While he was a runnin and a prayin for his sins to
    be forgave he see a natif nigger a sittin by the road side, and the
    natif nigger had three jest such snakes twisted all round his naked
    arms and bitin, real cruel, but he had got all their tails into one hand.</p>

  <p>Then Uncle Ned he stopped and said: “Poor feller, I have been bit too.
    As there isnt any hope for us now, we will sell our lifes as dear as we
    can to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> them deadly cobrys.”</p>

  <p>So he threw off his coat and pitched in and grabbed the snakes tails
    too. Then the native nigger he sed: “Thankee, sir, I guess we will be
    able for to manage them now. There is to be a party tonight, and I have
    been tryin for more than half a hour to braid these fellers into a
    necklace for the stomach of my wife’s belly, but they are so squirmy I
    thought I would have to give it up.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he was a stonished, and he said: “What! isnt them reptiles pizen?”</p>

  <p>The natif nigger he said: “How can I know? Do you suppose I ever et one?”</p>

  <p>One day my father he spoke up and said: “Johnny, did you ever hear
    about the good man which found a frozen snake and warmed it in his
    bosom, and when the snake got nice and comftable it bit him?”</p>

  <p>I said: “Yessir, every fool has heard about that.”</p>

  <p>Then my father he said: “My boy, the goodness isnt all on one side, for
    one time a snake found a man which was cold, and the snake warmed the
    man in its bosom too.”</p>

  <p>Then I said: “What did the man do when he had got the chill off him?” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

  <p>My father he said: “Well, Johnny, he digested.”</p>

  <p>Once there was a big snake which was a show, and the show man he put a
    dog in the cage for the snakes dinner. The dog he looked at the snake a
    while, and then he said: “That is the biggest sausage that I ever saw.
    I dont believe it could be et all to one meal by any dog which roams
    the palmy plain.”</p>

  <p>But bime by he was et his own self, and when he was nice swallered the
    snake he wank his eye, and said to his self: “The man which invented
    self stuffin sausages wasnt no friend to dogs.”</p>

  <p>A other snake which was a show swallered its blanket, and when the show
    man missed it he said, the show man did: “Ide jest like to catch the
    gum dasted thief which steals folkses bed clothes!”</p>

  <p>He give the snake a other blanket, but watched for to catch the thief.
    When he see the snake a swollerin that one he went and fetched a pillow
    and threw it to the snake and said: “If you are makin up your bed for
    to sleep in side your self you will need this, and when you have turned
    in I will pass down a hot water bottle for your feets, and make you
    comftable. What time would you like to be woke in the mornin?”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

  <p>Snakes eats hop toads and snaps at the hand which feeds it, but dogs
    is all rite. Snakes skins their selfs once a year, and one time me and
    Mister Brily, thats the fat butcher, we see one do it. When it was all
    done Mister Brily he said to the snake, Mister Brily did: “So far, so
    good, my fine feller, but how are you goin to get your innards out
    unless you got a knife?”</p>

  <p>The boa conscripter is a snake, but the rattler he makes the welkin
    ring! I asked Uncle Ned what was snakes made for, and he said: “I dont
    know, Johnny, honest, I didnt have nothing to do with it, but bein a
    mighty eloquent speecher I flatter my self I have made a shoreless sea
    of Demcrats. Your honorable father, which is a Repubcan, like you, he
    says that is about the same thing, but he is a child of darkness and
    disdain. I can tell you, though, about the snakes in the Garden of
    Eden, all exceptin the one which was tempted by Eve. When they had all
    been made, Adam he called them together and give them their names, and
    then he waved his arms and said: 'Now go 4th into all the waste places
    of the earth and multiply.’ </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

  <p>“They all slided away only but jest one, which lay still and shook its
    head, real sad. Then Adam he said: 'Why dont you do as I said? Off with
    you to once!’</p>

  <p>“But the snake, it spoke up and sed, the snake did: 'If you please,
    sir, Ime willing to go 4th, but I cant multiply. Ime a adder. You told
    me so your self.’”</p>

  <p>I asked Uncle Ned what makes the rattler have rattles, and he said:
    “Johnny, he doesnt. That is a optical delusion due to idleness in the
    observer. What they mistake for rattles is the last joints of the
    spine of his back bone, and it come about this way. The rattler he was
    created so ugly that it strangled him for to look at his self, and when
    he drew near any thing for to be sociable it fled amain. Well, one day
    in the Garden of Eden, he shedded his skin like all snakes had been
    told to do, and a other snake it shedded its skin too. So the rattler
    he backed into the other snakes skin for to hide his ugly, but it was
    too short, so the rattler bit off a inch or two and let a few joints of
    the spine of his back stick out, and they rattle when he shakes with
    fright, which is frequent. What scares him the worst is when a boy is
    about to step on him with bare feets. Johnny, you should be kind to the
    poor rattler and not step on it if there is plenty of room.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

  <p>“And now, my lad, I will tell you about a feller which drinked whiskey,
    which is equal bad. Me and the feller and a doctor was a campin in
    the forest, and the doctor had brought along a jug of whisky for to
    cure snake bites. One day him and me went out for to shoot bears, and
    when we come home to camp the feller he was lyin down in the tent, so
    dead drunk that he didn’t know a thing and was to the point of death!
    Johnny, it is awful to see a drinkard when he is himself, so I tore my
    hair and bewailed loud and shrill, but the doctor he sat down for to
    think, and bime be he said: 'I got it, I got it!’</p>

  <p>“Then he rushed away into the jingle, and pretty soon he come back
    with a rattler in the end of a long split stick, which he poked at
    the feller and it bit him many a time and oft. Johnny, it sounds like
    a mystery, and I wouldn’t ask you to believe it if I didnt tell it
    myself, but them snake bites they beat the fell intent of that whisky,
    for the feller he sprang up and evanished into the bosky fastness, and
    is now holdin a office of trust and profit in Kansas.”</p>

  <p>I asked Uncle Ned what became of the rattler, and he said, Uncle Ned
    did: “Thats a mighty sad story, Johnny,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> and I don’t like to dwell up
    on it. We took the snake outside the tent and let it go, and the first
    thing it done was to tie itself in a double bow knot and stick the ends
    through. Then it raveled it self out, and stood on its head, and waved
    its tail in air, and said it was the Queen of Sheby.”</p>

  <p>Injins eats snakes, but give me a pie, with lots of spice, and a apple
    dumplin, and some stewed squash, and plenty spunge cake, and a lot of
    sossage, and some more spunge cake, and some pickles, and all I can eat
    of chicken gizards, which is the stuff of life!</p>

    <h3 id="FROGS">FROGS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">FROGS was one time catter pillers. When you have et a catter in your
    salad it would have been a frog if you didnt. A feller named Esop says
    there was a ox which tried for to be a frog and busted. If it didnt
    bust it would have et hay and hooked and give milk. The best place to
    find frogs is after a rain, but they jump before you can get your hands
    on them, and them which dont will slip through your fingers like they
    was buttered, but when they fall on the ground you can see their white
    bellies if you look real quick.</p>

  <p>One night there was a lot of frogs in a lake, and there was a fire
    on the shore, and they all stuck their heads up for to see the fire,
    and the water froze, and when they tried to take their heads in they
    couldnt. So they held a council, and each laid his views before the
    king frog, which was in the middle, and there was jest as many plans
    for freein the whole lot as there was frogs which couldnt move a inch.
    The king he didnt say nothing, but looked mighty wise. When the sun
    melted them out in the mornin <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>they said: “What a good and wise king we
    have, for to get us out of trouble! Let us go and thank him.”</p>

  <p>But when they went to thank him they couldn’t find nothing to thank,
    only but jest his head, for a cat fish had bit off the king’s body
    early in the session. Then they said the king had died for his peoples.</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he said, Uncle Ned did: “Johnny, frogs is fine and gay, but
    the batrakian is a monster of the ocean blue. He has a mouth like a
    cavern in a hill, and a eye accordin. He is green as a meadow in spring
    time, exceptin the stomach of his belly, which is as the winter land
    scope. His voice is like the music of a saw mill and nations hear
    entranced. When he arises in his wrath his course is as the eagles
    flight, and when he revisits the earth whence he sprang from, the
    waters receive him with a roar which makes the heavens be mute!”</p>

  <p>Then I spoke up and said: “Thats what a frog does too.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he said: “All animated nature has points of resemble. The
    postage stamp is like the sword fish, cause it is a sticker, the polly
    wog is like the feller which writes short stories, cause his tail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> is
    not to be continued, and the wife is like the tagger, cause she roars
    like distant thunder. I forgot to tell you that the batrakian is a
    hunch back, but it isn’t good luck for to touch his hunch, for you
    will get your feets wet if you try to, for he is the slickest citizen
    you ever seen and departs this life for a other and wetter world at a
    moments notice, automattical.”</p>

  <p>I said: “Thats like frogs too.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he looked mighty hurt and shook his head, and bime by said:
    “Johnny, you got a bad habit of interruptin for to say some fool thing
    just as a feller is gettin truly eloquent, but since you mention frogs
    I will tell you a story.</p>

  <p>“One time a feller from Kansas was casted away on the coast of New
    Jersey and was a starvin, when he found a bushel of oysters and sat
    down for to eat them every little bit up. Then he see a native nigger a
    little way off, a sittin by a fire, and went to him for to be sociable,
    takin the oysters along. The native nigger was cookin frogs, and he
    said, real polite: 'Have some.’</p>

  <p>“The Kansas feller he said: 'What! are you going to eat them gum dasted
    reptiles?’ </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

  <p>“The native nigger said: 'Pardon me, they are very good, what are you
    eatin your self?’</p>

  <p>“The feller pointed to the oysters, and the nig turned white like he
    was a sheet and said: 'O Lordy, take them nasty things out of my sight,
    or I shall die of the flops!’</p>

  <p>“Then the Kansas feller he said: 'I cant take them away, nor eat them
    either, cause the sight of your diet has give me the colly wobbles in
    my lap!’</p>

  <p>“In a low green valley where the jay bird sings his requiem by the sad
    sea waves 2 grassy mounds mark the spot where these beautiful youths
    perished in their prides, each poisoned by the vituals that he didn’t
    eat. Let it teach you, my boy, for to not despise any food which a
    bountiful Providence has supplied for to sustain the lifes of his
    meanest cretures.”</p>

  <p>But if it was me and Billy we would et the oysters and give the frogs
    to the poor, cause frogs is fossils, but oysters is pork and makes the
    face of man to shine!</p>

  <p>Oysters is natives of the tropics, and is found only in high latitudes,
    but the rhi nosey rose is a brother to the ox.</p>

  <p>Mister Brily, which is the fat butcher, he can slaughter a ox real
    fine, and his son Jack, which is the wicked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> sailor, says it was the
    sight of the beautiful blood that made him be a pirate. If I had saw
    Jack a piratin I would rang out my voice across the billows and said:
    “Heave too, you naughty man, or I will belch 4th a broad side this minute!”</p>

  <p>Then Jack would come to my ship, mighty pale and trembly, and I would
    embrue my hands in his gore!</p>

  <p>I asked Uncle Ned what for the bull frog had sech a horse voice and he
    said: “One day in the Garden of Eden, when Adam was passin by a pond,
    he heard a voice a singin sweet and clear, like a lark at the dawning
    of the day. He looked a long time, and bime by he seen the bull frogs
    head stickin out of the pond, and it was it singin. But Adam he said:
    'Here, you, what for did you play truant wen I was naming all the
    animals? You come right out of that and be give a name.’</p>

  <p>“So the singster come out on the bank and Adam named it bulbul frog,
    cause bulbul means nightingale, and then Adam said: 'I cant deny my
    self the happiness to hear you sing some more.’</p>

  <p>“The bulbul frog it started for to sing again, but it couldn’t utter a
    note, only but jest a harsh croak, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> it had took cold by comin out
    of the water in to the sun shine. Then Adam said: 'I was mistook. I
    thought it was you which I heard singin before. Ime sorry I give you
    that name, or named you at all, for not any name is bad enough for a
    feller with a voice like that.’</p>

  <p>“So Adam he kicked it clear into the middle of the pond, but it has the
    cold to this day.”</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">DOGS is many kinds, but the Newfoundlin feller is the king of the ocean
    and saves babies from bein drowned in the briny deeps. The spotty one
    which has the swear name he trots along under his masters coach, and
    when a man is run over he finishes him. The dog is called a quinine for
    to distinguish him from the fox, which is a squid. Dogs is desiduous,
    for they have got 4 feets and leaps from crag to crag. When some feller
    is a dyin the dog howls mornful, but the under taker he says the
    doctrin of mortality is a sublime faith.</p>

  <p>One time there was a dog which hadnt any tail, cause it was cut off,
    but its naughty for to cut them off, for the Bible it says: “Him that
    sheddeth his brothers bleed his own bleed shall be sheddeth.” There was
    a other dog which had a long slick tail, like a whip lash, and thems
    the jockies for me. The dog which had a tail it said to the dog which
    didn’t: “When your master gives you a bone what do you waggle?” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

  <p>The other one he said: “I waggle the bone.”</p>

  <p>Then the tail feller said: “When he kicks you for bein so ugly what
    have you for to put between your legs to show that your feel is hurt?”</p>

  <p>The bob feller said: “I put half a mile between my legs and hisn, what
    more could I want, exceptin, maybe, the other half of the mile?”</p>

  <p>The dog which had the tail it thought a while and then it wiggled its
    ear, much as to say: “This cripple hasnt any tail, but he has got a
    head thats no mere toy.” But pretty soon he began for to smile, and
    bime by said: “What have you for the boys to tie a tin can onto?”</p>

  <p>Then the other one shook his head, real sad and said: “You got the
    advantage of me there, thats a fact. This no tail of mine is jest as
    good as any for business, but in matters of pleasure and sociableness
    it fails lamentable!”</p>

  <p>One time in Mexico, where the dogs dont have no hair, there was a
    traveler, and he called his man and said: “James,” for that was his
    mans name, “Ime going for to adopt the fashion of the country. You take
    my dog and shave it all over, every little bit of hair off.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

  <p>James said he would, but he was afraid the dog would bite him, so he
    swopped it off for a Mexican dog, same size, and took that one to his
    master, which said: “What a difference that makes! It looks almost like
    a other dog.”</p>

  <p>Pretty soon after, the traveler took a walk down town, mighty proud of
    his fashionble dog, which James led with a string. Bime by they come to
    a Mexican man sittin in a open door hollerin: “Walk up, gents, walk up,
    only ten cents for to see the show, walk up!”</p>

  <p>When the new dog heard the show man it busted away from James, like it
    was shot out of a cannon, and jumped right onto the show man, tickled
    most to death to see him, cause he was its old master. The show man he
    hollered wild and shouted: “Outch, outch! Your savage dog has bit me
    cruel, and I got a large family to suport!”</p>

  <p>The traveler said to James: “Take the dog home this minute, shavin has
    spoiled its temper.”</p>

  <p>When the dog had gone he said to the man which had the big, helpless
    family: “Dont cry, my good feller, heres 10 dollars for you, what have
    you got in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> show?”</p>

  <p>The show man he said: “Walk right in and see, sir, you are on the free
    list cause you paid me for my awful pain.”</p>

  <p>The traveler he went in the show, and there wasn’t any thing to see
    only but jest his old dog, which was in a cage, and there was a sign

  <p>Mister Gipple he says that one time he had a mighty homely dog and the
    dogs name was Calamity. One day Mister Gipple was took sick and sent
    for the doctor and when the doctor had come in and said “Good mornin,
    I hope you are well,” Calamity came in too. Mister Gipple, for to be
    playful, said: “Doctor, what will you give me for my dog?” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

  <p>The doctor he looked at Calamity a while, real thoughtful, and then he
    said: “I will give you some thing for your leprosy if you have it, but
    I dont think I have any medicine strong enough to cure you of that dog.
    I am a old doctor, but I never have seen such awful symptoms.”</p>

  <p>My father, which is absent minded and cant see very well when he has
    left his spettacles in his other coat, he was a walkin, my father was,
    and there was a big dog which he was acquainted with. It was chewin
    a short stick, which was in the corner of its mouth, like it was a
    cigar. When my father see the stick in the dogs mouth he took the cigar
    that he was smokin his self, and knocked off the ashes with his little
    finger, and held it down to the dog and said: “Have a light?”</p>

  <p>But when the dog didn’t do any thing my father seen what a jackus he
    had made of his self, and he got red in the face like he was a rose,
    and made a bow and said: “O, I beg your pardon.”</p>

  <p>My father he is a Repubcan, jest like me, but Uncle Ned says Repubcans
    is engaged in a nofarious conspuracy for to over throw the liberty of
    the peoples and prevent him bein a post master.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

  <p>One day my sisters young man, wich hates dogs, he was goin along the
    street, and there was a woman and a little wooly dog. When he come up
    behind for to pass them the dog it dropped back and made a face at him,
    which made him awful mad, so he kicked it way up in the air, like it
    was a bird, and it sang like eagles as it flew. The woman surveyed its
    flight with horrify, and when it come down on the other side the street
    she turned around for to sass some body, but my sisters young man he
    was mighty absorbed in a news paper. But the woman she said: “You aint
    no gentle man!”</p>

  <p>He looked up, awful innocent and real hurt, and said: “Why not?”</p>

  <p>Then the woman she hestated and stamered and blushed, but bime by said:
    “Because you read news papers in the public street, and that isnt good
    manners.”</p>

  <p>So he folded the paper real careful up and put it in his pocket and
    said: “I beg your pardon, madam, I was only but jest glancin at the
    semi annual report of the Society for Entertainin Heavenly Visitants
    When They Light on this Mundane Sphere, cause I am the presider of it.
    I think I jest now saw one of them fellers light right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> over there. I
    go for to seek my duty.”</p>

  <p>Then he crossed to the other side of the street, where the wooly dog
    had come down in the weeds and was lost to view, and the woman she said
    she never in all her life!</p>

  <p>But if he would kick Bildad, thats our new dog, Bildad would rend him
    limb from limb, for Bil he is the king of beasts, and is give dominion
    over every creepy thing.</p>

  <p>Dogs live to a green old age and are much esteemed, but hogs waller,
    and Mister Pitchel, which is the preacher, he prays and takes up a
    colection. And thats why the Bible it says be of good cheer, for ye
    shall all be casted into the lake of fire and brim stone.</p>

  <p>One day a womans dog it bit a tramp and she said: “Poor feller, Ime so
    sorry my dog et you.”</p>

  <p>The tramp he said: “Thats all right, lady, I et his brother.”</p>

  <p>When a dog waggles his tail, that makes him happy, but when a man is
    happy he shakes hands and stomps on his hat. Every boy ought to have a
    dog, cause boys are masculine, but girls are efemeral.</p>

  <p>There was a man had a dog which was a biter, the dog was, and one day
    it bit the butcher which brought the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>meat. So when the butcher come
    with the meat next day he brought along a ox liver and threw it to the
    dog and said: “You eat that and let honest folks be.”</p>

  <p>But the liver was so bad the dog wouldn’t eat it and slank into its
    kennel and the butch he went away. Bime by the man which had the dogs
    wife she come out for to feed the chickens and she see the liver. So
    she called the man which had the dog, and rang her hands and said: “O
    Jacob, some thing awful has happened!”</p>

  <p>The man which had the dog he could smell the liver, and he said: “It is
    a happenin now.”</p>

  <p>But his wife she weeped and said the dog had tore the butcher every
    little tiny bit up. Then the dog sticked its head out of the kennel and
    waggled its ear, much as to say: “You dont see no signs of a streggle,
    do you?”</p>

  <p>Then the butch he come back along the road, and the woman she see him.
    She was furious mad and she said to her husband: “Jacob Brown, if you
    cant think of nuthing better to do than harrow your wifes feelins
    up mornin, noon and night, jest for to go and tell it to your low
    drinkard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> friends, I am a goin home to my mother.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he says they are all jest like that, but my sisters young man
    says she is different. He says the yuman eye is the mirror of the soul
    and when he looks in to hern he sees a holy angel. Then she is happy.</p>

  <p>The colly is a dog of great inteligence and folds up the sheeps, but
    when the ole ram shakes his head and stomps his feets the colly says:
    “I guess I will knock off work now, for I have got the wobbles real bad.”</p>

  <p>Then the sheepherd he kicks the colly, and the ole ram he buts the
    sheepherd, and the little labms they gambol on the game.</p>

  <p>A man in Indy he lived in a lonely cabin in the jingle, and one dark
    night he was woke up by a awful poundin on his door and loud calls for
    help. When he opened the door a feller he jumped in and closed it and
    held it fast and hollered: “Keep him out, keep him out!”</p>

  <p>The house man he lit a candle, and said what under the sun, and
    goodness gracious, and for the lands sake, and whats up?</p>

  <p>The scary feller he said: “Its a tagger, thats whats up! He was a
    lurkin around your door, and spranged at my throat, but I clutched him
    and flang him afar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> Jest look at the fur which I tored out of him!”</p>

  <p>The house feller he looked real close, and then he said, the house
    feller did: “My friend, that is wool off of my pet lam.”</p>

  <p>The other chap spoke up and said: “Thats jest it, thats jest it! I
    renched it out of the taggers teeths. You better go out to once and rub
    some hair restorer on to your gum dasted lam.”</p>

  <p>Then he said good night and went away fearless in to the jingle.</p>

  <p>Mister Pitchel, thats the preacher, he says a naughty boy tied a tin
    can to a dogs tail and the dog it ran through a Sunday school, in at
    one door and out at a other, howlin like its heart was broke, and the
    boys all jumped up and hollered hooray! Then Mister Pitchel he spoke up
    and said: “My children, it is wicked for to cheer, cause the boy which
    done that will come to a bad end.”</p>

  <p>Then a old deacon he said: “I guess thats so, but it looks like the dog
    would get there first.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he said: “Johnny, when the dox hoond was created it was a
    roly poly feller, like a foot ball. One day Adam he told it for to go
    and round up the rhi nosey rose, and the hi potamus, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> the beasts
    of the field, and the fools of the air, and the fishes of the sea, and
    bring them in for to be give their names. And Adam he added: 'Dont be
    long about it.’</p>

  <p>“But the dox, which was lazy, said to itself: 'Ile be as long as I please.’</p>

  <p>“Adam over heard it, and called the dox back and said: 'On the
    contrary, you will be as long as I please.’</p>

  <p>“Then the dox hoond it begun for to shrink at the equater and grow at
    the poles, and bime by it was as it is saw to-day, a towerin horizontle
    monument to the sin of dissobedience.”</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple he was a missionnary preacher in Madgigasker, and one
    time it was Sunday. Mister Gipple is a good man and he said he would
    go to church. So he went, and there was ten thousand hundred natif
    niggers, all worshipin a big wood idol, which was the ugliest thing he
    ever seen. Mister Gipple he was just a goin for to tell them it was
    wicked to worship sech a homely god, when he see his big yellow stump
    tail bull dog walk into the church and sit down longside the idol
    and look his worst. Then the king of the natif niggers he come over
    to Mister Gipple and nudged him and said: “See here, you ungrateful
    feller, I been mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> nice to you, and give you a dozen wives, and
    made you a duke, and let you wear a pecox feather, and havnt threw up
    your color to you, nor et you. But there cant be only but jest one
    religion here, and if you dont take that gum dasted god of yourn out of
    this diocese Ile cut his ears off!”</p>

  <p>I asked Uncle Ned why dogs has a tail, and he said, Uncle Ned did: “The
    first one, which was created in six days, hadnt one. It was a bull dog,
    like the one that Mister Gipple has told you of. One day Adam met the
    bull dog and said, mighty polite; 'Good mornin.’</p>

  <p>“The bull said: 'Good mornin your self, I am glad to see you.’</p>

  <p>“Adam said: 'You dont look it, you are the maddest lookin feller which
    I ever met. Why dont you smile?’</p>

  <p>“So the bull dog braced his self against a tree and drew a deep breathe
    and smiled. Johnny, if you have ever had the bad luck for to see a bull
    dog smile I neednt dwell on that painful perform. Adam he jumped back
    out of range and said: 'Is that the best that you can do?’ </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

  <p>“The bull he answered: 'Yessir, but I could do better if I had more teeths.’</p>

  <p>“Adam said: 'I guess there aint any more.’</p>

  <p>“Then he thought a while, and bime by said: 'Ole man, if you will
    promise not to smile any more only but jest when you are furious mad I
    will give you some thing for to xpress your lighter emotions with and
    draw the observers atention away from where you look like you have a
    grouch.’</p>

  <p>“The dog said it was a whack and Adam give him a tail for to waggle
    when feelin good. But mostly man kind believes the tail is lying, and
    cuts it off.”</p>

  <p>Taggers is cats and birds is reptiles, but the dog is a manual and
    brings forth his young alive.</p>

    <h3 id="THE_PIG">THE PIG</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">PIGS is from ancient times. When a pig is fed it slobbers. But my
    father he says that when you are a going to be killed in the fall of
    the year whats the use of bein a gentleman jest for such a little time?
    Some pigs which go to fairs are so fat that you cant tell which is the
    head till you set down a bucket of slops, and then the end which swings
    around and points at it like a campus, that is it.</p>

  <p>One time a feller was drivin a pig through our town with a string tied
    to one of its hind feets. The feller fastened the string to a telegraph
    pole and went in a saloon for to get some beer, and Jack Brily he let
    the pig loose and tied a smoked ham in its place. When the feller come
    out he untied the string from the telegraph pole and wound it around
    his wrist, and then he looked in the weeds for his pig. He looked at
    the ham, and then he looked up at the telgraph wire, and then he said:
    “Lectricity is gum dasted fire! Ide jest like to get my hands on to the
    man which sent that last dispatch!”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

  <p>One day a boy which went in a butcher shop had busted a button off his
    jacket and was playin with it. He snapt it in some sossage meat and
    then he didnt dare to ask for it out. Next day the boys father was to
    the butchers house for dinner and they had sossage, cause the butcher
    he knew the boys father was crazy fond of it, but the boys father he
    got the brass button in his mouth. He took it out and looked at it a
    long time, and then he said: “Excuse me, but where did you get the pig
    which this sausage is made out of?”</p>

  <p>The butch he said: “I disremember.”</p>

  <p>Then the man he weeped and said, a other time: “Excuse me, but I guess
    you got the wrong pig by the ear and have chopt up my little Charley.”</p>

  <p>The butch he was astonish, but he thought the man was crazy and must
    be yumored, so he said, the butch did: “Thats a fact, but it was a
    mistake, and if you wont say nothing about it I will give you a other
    boy.”</p>

  <p>The man he brightend up and said: “Thats pretty fair, but excuse me,
    fore we talk business I will jest help my self to a other plate of this
    one.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

  <p>Big pigs is hogs and the she one is a sow, but if I was a hog Ide look
    a little higher for a wife, cause the Bible it says they shall be one
    flesh.</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple which was one time a missionary preacher in Afca, he
    said: “Johnny, di ever tell you about Mumboogla?”</p>

  <p>I said no he didnt, and he said: “Mumboogla has ten thousand hundred
    folks and is noted for its king, which is the fattest and blackest in
    the world. When I went there for to spread the light the king he sent
    for me and said: 'What new fangle religion is this which you are a
    preachin?’</p>

  <p>“I xpounded the livin faith to him a long while and he listened mighty
    polite, but when I had got done he spoke up and said, the king did: 'If
    you had come last week I would have made all my peoples be Christians,
    but it is too late, for the scales have fell from our eyes and we are
    now worshipers of the Ever Lastin Truth!’</p>

  <p>“Then the king called his high priest and said: 'Take this feller and
    show him the Ever Lastin Truth.’</p>

  <p>“So the high he took me and shaved my head and washed me with rose
    water and anointed my whiskers with oil of hummin birds and put a nice
    new breech cloth on me and led me to the temple.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> Then he told me for
    to crawl on the stomach of my belly under a star spangle curtain, and
    there in the dim religious light of tallow candles held by 3 other
    priests was the Ever Lastin Truth! Johnny, it was jest a great big,
    shovel nose, screw tail, razor back Arkansaw hog!</p>

  <p>“I never felt so insulted in my life, but the Bible it says blessed
    are the meek, for they shall inhabit the earth. I arose my self up to
    my full statute and said: 'Is it possible that you heathens in your
    blindnesses worship that gum dasted reptile?’</p>

  <p>“The high he said: 'We sure do, cause it is a god.’</p>

  <p>“I said how did he know it was, and he said: 'Cause it is the only one
    which is in the world. One night last week it come ashore in the howlin
    of the storm and stampeeded a whole village. Then it put the kings
    army to flight and et a major general. Then it turned to and licked a
    rhi nosey rose, 3 taggers and a cracky dile, and after dessolatin 7
    provinches with fire and sword, it moved on the capital with measured
    tread, and pausin a while for to scratch it self against the great Idol
    of Hope and Slaughter, it entered the Temple of Black Despair, and
    puttin both fore feets in the never failin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> fountain of maidens blood,
    drinked it every drop up. By all them signs, which my holy office
    enabled me to interpret, I knew it wasnt a yuman being, but a awful
    god, and the king done the rest.’</p>

  <p>“Then, Johnny, I remembered that a ship from Peory, Illinoy, was over
    due at Mumbassy, 100 miles up the coast, and I knew that this monster
    was the sole surviver. But what was the use? What kind of a chance
    had Reason against Faith, in minds which had never knew the light of
    Revelation? So I felt called for to deliver some other land from errors
    chain, and buyin 9 camel loads of ephalents teeths with a pound of
    glass beads, I sailed for Indianas coral strand.”</p>

  <p>But if Billy, thats my brother, had been there he would have slew the
    high priest and the fat king and weltered in their gore!</p>

  <p>There was a pig and it was a rootin up a mans cabbage garden. The man
    which owned the cabbages he snook up behind the pig and catched it by
    its hind feets for to throw it over the fence. But the pig it got hold
    of a cabbage stalk with its mouth and wouldnt let go. The man which
    owned the cabbages said to his self: “What can I do? If I let go it
    will run <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>over my flowers, and if I dont it will pull up the cabbage.”</p>

  <p>Bime by the man which owned the cabbages wife she come out and see how
    things was, and women dont know nothing, so she got a bucket of scaldin
    hot water, and threw the water on the pig and the cabbage too, and it
    killed them both, they was so boiled. The man he let go and thought a
    while, and then he said to his wife: “Thank you, now jest bring the
    vinigar and mustard and help your self to what you see before you.”</p>

  <p>I asked Uncle Ned if he knew what made pigs have a curly tail, and he
    said: “Its mighty singlar about that, Johnny, and I was jest a goin to
    tell you. One time in the Garden of Eden the pig it see a apple fall
    from a tree and made off for to eat it. But Adam he said: 'Hold hard,
    there, my friend, apples is mighty bad medicine, cause I know how it is
    my self. If you eat it you will know good from bad, and your wife wont
    seem half so nice as she does now.’</p>

  <p>“But the pig it wouldnt stop, so Adam catched it by the tail, but
    couldnt hold it, for the tail slicked out of his hand. So he twisted
    the tail round his finger and drew the pig back out of mortle peril,
    but when he pulled his finger out of the twist <span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>the tail stayed curly
    unto this day.</p>

  <p>“And now, my boy, havin give you the sientificle explain of that
    phenomnon, I will tell you about the dove, cause doves is pigs too,
    when it comes to eatin. One day Adam was a walkin in the Garden and
    he see a dove sittin on a tree, a cooin real mornful, like it hadnt a
    friend in the world, and it hadnt, for there was lots of feathers under
    the tree, and Adam knew it had et its mate. But he said: 'Poor little
    feller, where does it hurt you?’</p>

  <p>“The dove it said: 'I have lost my wife, thats where it hurts me.’</p>

  <p>“Adam went on without sayin any more, but about a hour later he past
    that way again and seen the dove. It was all dubbled up, and its wings
    was crost on the stomach of its belly, mighty sick, and makin a doleful
    sounds, same as it did before. Adam he said: 'What are you a grievin
    about now, have you lost your wife again?’</p>

  <p>“The dove it said: 'Worse than that. I have found her!’</p>

  <p>“Then Adam he said: 'You cantankrous little cuss! You shall moan and
    wail for ever and ever, particlarly when you are happy.’” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

  <p>Doves is the symblem of peace cause they are fraid cats, and every
    livin thing can lick them easy. But the eagle he is a minister of the
    upper deep!</p>

  <p>When the eag has et too much dove he has the colic too, and moans
    awful. When Franky, thats the baby, has it mother gives him cat nip tea
    and ginger and pepmint and tobasco and pain killer and perry gorick
    and mustard and burnt brandy. Then the doctor he comes and gives him
    a emettic, real quick, and when it is all over he says: “Madam, your
    inteligence and promptness saved your childs life.”</p>

  <p>And that is all which is known to sience about pigs.</p>

    <h3 id="KANGAROONS">KANGAROONS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE wood chuck lives in a hole and is fat like he was butter, but the
    kangaroon leaps upon the fo and rends him lim from lim! Chucks is
    mammals but the kang is a grass hopper and moves in a mysterious way.
    The she one has a pocket on her belly and puts every thing in it which
    dont belong to her. One time a kang which was a show she got out of the
    cage and stole some black smith tools and hid them in her pouch. When
    she was put back in the cage the black smith come and told the show
    man that some gum dasted thief had stole his kit. The show man he knew
    how it was, and went in the kangs cage and took out his knife and made
    believe to rip her open. Then he put his arm in her pouch and pulled
    out a hammer and a tongs and some other things, and said: “Is them
    yourn?”</p>

  <p>The black he was a stonish. He looked a while at the tools and then
    he looked a while at the kang, which was eatin a wisp of hay, real
    peaceful and happy, and then he looked at the show man, and bime be he
    said: “No, you gam doodled hipnotist, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>thems opticle ilusions, but mine
    was real, sure enough, flesh and blood tools.”</p>

  <p>The show man he said: “Is that so? Then I guess we better go and open
    the ostridge.”</p>

  <p>But the black he was mad and left the sceene with slow and stately
    tread.</p>

  <p>Now Ile tell you a other, which Uncle Ned told me. A scientificle
    feller went to the zoo and seen a kang which was out of doors. He
    looked at it a long time and then he said to a keeper, the scientificle
    feller did: “You got a jewel here, cause it is a xtinct specie, which
    I cant rightly name off hand. Of course it cant walk with such legs as
    them, and it may be what the Scriptures call a creepin thing.”</p>

  <p>The keeper he said: “Maybe it will help you identify him if I tell you
    his name is Rickoshay. Make a effort, Rick, and creep for the gentman.”</p>

  <p>Then the show man he whacked the roon on the tail with his stick, and
    the roon it went away like it was shot out of a gun and in a half
    dozen leaps was lost to view in a long cloud of dust. Then the other
    feller he shooked his head, real wise, and said: “Once more has Science
    demstrated the falibility of the Scriptures and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> over threw Religion.”</p>

  <p>A traveler in the torpid zone, where the kangaroon is to home, he see
    one sittin by the road side on its haunches, and its fore paws was
    hangin down on its breast like a little dogs which has been taught to
    beg. The traveler had a kind heart and he said: “Here you poor hungry
    thing, what ever you are, take a biscit.”</p>

  <p>But when he threw the biscit the kang it jumpt like lightnin a awful
    distance, and when it had lit it looked back and twinkled its ears,
    much as to say: “Never touched me!”</p>

  <p>The traveler he took out his note book and wrote: “This country is
    subject to great convulshions of nature, which cause some of the most
    sudden and remarkble up heavels known to science and baffles the
    generous instinckts of the yuman heart.”</p>

  <p>But my sisters young man, which told me the story, he says the greatest
    up heavle known to science is when the hi potamus rises from his beauty
    sleep and salutes the dawn.</p>

  <p>The old he kangaroon is a stag and the she feller is a duck bill and
    the little ones is katy dids, and thats why I say variety is the staff
    of life. The kangs tail is the biggest in the world and is highly
    respected for soup, but Jack Brily, which is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>the wicked sailor, says
    give him plum duff and a spankin breeze!</p>

  <p>Jack says he was one time ship wreck on a island, and was caught by
    some native niggers which took him before their king and said: “If you
    please, here is one of them gods which is some times washed ashore when
    the wind is west.”</p>

  <p>The king he loocked at Jack a while, and bime by he said: “Take him out
    and lick him till he gives us good weather for the coco nuts.”</p>

  <p>Jack he spoke up and said, Jack did: “I aint that kind of god. The one
    which could rule the weather was et by a shark jest fore he reached the
    land. Ime the feller which bestows good government.”</p>

  <p>The king said: “Then we havnt no use for you, cause we are mighty well
    off that way.”</p>

  <p>But one of the natif niggers he said: “I dont know about that. I guess
    we better lick him any how and see what comes of it.”</p>

  <p>Jack he said: “Never mind about the lickin, I will waive all pomp and
    ceremony and give you good govment any how if you do as I say, jest
    like they have in America, where I am worshipt the hardest. What kind
    of a king is that feller?”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

  <p>The Prime Minister he said he was a mighty good one, cause he had been
    kingin all his life.</p>

  <p>Jack he said: “Then what you need is rotasion in office. Turn him out
    to once and put in a new man which nearly one half the peoples have
    said they didn’t want.”</p>

  <p>The natifs said there wasn’t any sech man, cause when ever a bad man
    was seen he was took up and skinned alive. Jack he thought a while, and
    bime by he said: “Got any of them skins?”</p>

  <p>They said they guessed the last one took was in the rogues galery, and
    Jack said: “Stuff it and make it Presdent, and you will have liberty.”</p>

  <p>A nigger he spoke up and said: “We have liberty, what is a Presdent?”</p>

  <p>Jest then a other nigger come up, with a grip sack in his hand, and he
    said: “Where I come from we have a Presdent, what is liberty?”</p>

  <p>Then Jack walked over to that feller and shook his hand and said: “I
    am dog gone glad for to see you, old man, how was things goin when you
    left New York?” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

  <p>Patrick Henry he said: “Give me liberty or treat me mighty well in
    jail,” but George Washington he waved his big sticker and shouted the
    bottle cry of fredom! </p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">EPHALENTS is the biggest thing in the world, and it has got a proboscus
    with a hole through it. Some times the eph it gets its proboscus full
    of muddy water and blows it sky high and would put out a fire if there
    was one. The eph he has got a ear like the star spangle banner, but
    he cant wave it oer the home of the brave. Billy he says once a man
    put his head in a ephalents mouth, but their teeth is outside, so the
    feller which didnt was braver.</p>

  <p>The ephs proboscus is its nose, and old Gaffer Peters has a long one
    too. One night old Gaffer was to our house and his shadow was on the
    wall, and Uncle Ned he said for him to sit still and he would draw his
    profile. So Uncle Ned drew it on the wall, and made the nose about
    a foot long, you never seen such a nose! My father he said: “What
    a strikin likeness, I would have knew it with my eyes shut,” but
    old Gaffer he didn’t say nothing. But pretty soon he pulled out his
    hankchef and blew his nose, and said: “I got a mighty bad cold.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

  <p>Bime by he blew it again and said: “This cold of mine is a goin to
    carry me to my grave.”</p>

  <p>After a while he blew it some more and said: “What a dredfull swell up
    nose a bad cold gives a man in this gum dasted climate!”</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple he says that one time in Mully Gatawny there was a battle
    be tween the wites and the natif niggers, and the wites licked. Then
    the wite general he said to his mahoot, which is the feller which rides
    a ephalent and jabs its ears: “Here, Kibosh, you take your quadped and
    ride over the battle field and count the slained and the wounded of
    the enemy, never mind ourn. I want to make a roarin good report to the
    Govment. You will have to be mighty careful or you will miss some of
    them.”</p>

  <p>The mahoot he said: “Yessir, my eph is mighty sharp sighted with his
    feets.”</p>

  <p>Late in the evenin the mahoot came a jabbin his eph up to head quarter,
    and the poor thing was so tired that it wobbled, and its feet and laigs
    was red, like they was painted. The gen he said: “Kibosh, I fear there
    was a accdent to some poor feller. Didnt I tell you that menaggery of
    yourn would have to be careful about steppin on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> wounded?”</p>

  <p>Ki he sed: “Yessir, so he was, sir, I dont think he missed a single nigger.”</p>

  <p>The general, which was a good man, was awful shocked, and he wrote in
    his report: “I am sorry for to have to add that after the battle all
    of the wounded natifs, bein exposed to the open air, was atacked by
    a disease pecular to this climate, and phisicians was in vain. This
    scurge of the tropics is known as elphantiasis, or flatty degeneration
    of the chest. Make me a duke.”</p>

  <p>But the Bible it says we are all worms of the dust where there is any
    dust for to be a worm of.</p>

  <p>A other time Mister Gipple said: “Johnny, di ever tell you about the
    great king of Googum? I was in Googum when he died, and I asked the
    Prime Minister and the High Priest might I make a few remarks at the
    grave. The Prime said he guessed it would be all right if I wouldnt
    take up a colection, and the High said he would be mighty glad if I
    would relieve him of a sacred duty, cause he wanted to go a fishin.
    So on the day of the funeral I went to the grave. Johnny, you have
    frequent saw in the news papers a large audience discribed as 'a sea of
    up turned faces.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> It was that way there. But, Johnny, the up turned
    faces was all detatched from their respective bodies!</p>

  <p>“Bime by the Prime came. I swallered my feel as well as I could and
    said: 'I spose this is the custom of the country.’</p>

  <p>“The Prime he said: 'Yes, when the king dies we try for to make it a
    occasion of public sorry.’</p>

  <p>“Then I said: 'Where is my audience?’</p>

  <p>“The Prime he said: 'Ime him.’</p>

  <p>“I said: 'How about the mourners?’</p>

  <p>“The Prime he said: 'All them which we could catch are here, exceptin
    the public executor, which is tired and has gone home. Ile fetch him if
    you would like to make his acquaint.’</p>

  <p>“I thought a while, then I said: 'No, dont deprive him of his much
    needed rest. I met him in Illinoy.’</p>

  <p>“Then the Prime looked at his watch and said: 'It is time for you to
    begin the remarks.’</p>

  <p>“Then I rose my self up to my full highness and looked him in the eye,
    like I was a eagle, and said: 'The only remarks which I feel inspired
    for to make is that of all the gum dasted galoots and cantankers that
    I ever met you are the head center,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span> the xtreme limit, the farthest
    north! If I had had you over in New Jersey, where your cries couldnt be
    heard up at the mercy seat, Ide lambaste you til your unbelievin soul
    would quit its tennement of mud and fly to evils that it knows not of!’</p>

  <p>“Then, Johnny, I departed out of that place of wrath and tears by leaps
    and bounds and came back to the land of the free, where a feller which
    behaves hisself neednt hold his head on with both hands, where the
    Repubcan party scatters peace and plenty of offices oer a smilin land,
    and where if the Presdent was to die every day of his life a other
    would be elected without sacrificial rites.”</p>

  <p>But if the public xecutor would come for to cut my head off cause the
    king died I would cleave him into twain! </p>

    <h3 id="THE_TOOTSY_WOOTSY">THE TOOTSY WOOTSY</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">UNCLE NED he said: “Johnny, you have wrote about all the other quadpeds
    which roam the plain, but I guess you have forgot the tootsy wootsy.”</p>

  <p>I said what was it like, and Uncle Ned he said, Uncle Ned did: “It
    isnt like any thing which is on the earth, or in the heavens under the
    earth, or in the whisky and water which is all over the earth, but
    jest get your pencil and write what I say about it, for I have been in
    Pattigony and seen it in its natif wild.”</p>

  <p>So Uncle Ned he lit his pipe and laid the blazin match real careful on
    Mose which is the cats back, which springed away like he was shot out
    of a gun, and said, Uncle Ned did: “The tootsy wootsy is found in many
    lands, for it is mighty audible and you cant miss it.”</p>

  <p>I said: “Is it a animal, or a bird, or a fish, or only jest a inseck?”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he said: “It is in a class by it self, though it is some like
    all them fellers, and snakes too. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> color of the tootsy is unknown
    to science, for, as Shakspeare says, it is subdude to what it works
    in, which is mostly dirt. When it is washed with hydrate of soap it is
    fire red from xertion and howl. It is a domesticle beast, same as the
    hi potamus, and roars like distant thunder. You will naturally want to
    know what it lives on, and that is the most singlar thing, cause it
    hasnt got much teeth, as a general rule, yet it is a beast of prey.
    Every thing which it can catch goes in to its mouth, and it is frequent
    pizened.</p>

  <p>“The tootsy wootsy doesn’t live to a great age, like the ephalent, the
    turtle and the testator, but when 3 or 4 summers has past over its head
    it changes from a quaderped into a brat.”</p>

  <p>I said what was brats, and he said: “A brat, my boy, is the frog of
    which the tootsy is the tad pole, or polly wog.”</p>

  <p>Then I asked him did the toot drop its tail, like the wog, and he said:
    “I cant jest recollect whether it has a tail or not, but if it has I
    guess it better drop it, cause when it becomes a brat its mother, which
    is a great imitator of yuman being’s will wear it off with her palm.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

  <p>Then I said: “If I met a tootsy wootsy I would draw my big sword and
    cut its head off, and smash the spine of its back, and holler hooray!”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he said: “Yes, I know you would, cause you are brave like
    soldiers, but jest now I guess you better go and wipe Frankys nose and
    slick him up a bit, poor little feller, cause his father is a comin
    home pretty soon, and we will give him the supprise of his life.”</p>

  <p>So I washed Franky up, real nice and white, which howled, and Uncle Ned
    comed his hair. Bime by my father he come in, and while he was a takin
    off his over coat he see Franky and stopped with it half off. He looked
    a while and then he took the over coat the other half off and hung it
    up and came back and said: “That child looks quite a little like our
    Franky, doesnt it, Edard? Whose is he?” </p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">MISTER GIPPLE he says in Africa the natif niggers eats nothing only
    but just grass hoppers, and one time a nig he see a hopper sittin on
    a stone, with its feets pulled in, all ready for to jump. The natif
    nigger he smiled sad, like a hi potamus, and said: “How mournful to
    think that fellers which is like 2 brothers should distrust one a other
    jest cause I am a nigger, which has a black skin, how can I help that?”</p>

  <p>But the hopper it wiggled one whisker, much as to say: “It isnt the
    color of your skin, old man, but the un neighborly way which you have
    of tuckin it out.”</p>

  <p>Bildad, thats the new dog, was sick one day and et a blade of grass
    for to make hisself throw it up, but there was a hopper on the grass
    and before Bildad chewed it he noticed that some thing was the matter
    and he opened his mouth again and stood real still for to see what
    would happen, but the hopper it kept a jumpin in Bildads mouth. Then he
    started in and shook his head so fast you couldnt see it, but it was no
    use. Pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> soon he stopped to see if it was all right, but it wasnt.
    Then he got down on his knees and rubbed his hed on the ground, first
    on one side and then on the other, and my father he spoke up and said,
    fore he thought: “Look at that dog a stroppin his razor!”</p>

  <p>The Bible it says awful things will happen to them which eats grass
    like Nebbicudnezer. I asked Jack Brily, which is the wicked sailor,
    what was the awfulest thing which ever happened to him. Jack he thought
    a while and then he said, Jack did:</p>

  <p>“Johnny, a feller which his life is on the ocean wave has a lot of
    blood cuddling adventers that he hasnt got time for to classify
    accordin to their awfulness, and maybe I am mistook in thinkin that
    the one which I am about to relate is the limit, but it made me stop
    follerin the sea and stay home for to help my father in the meat shop.</p>

  <p>“One time I was on a ship which was casted away, and I was the only man
    which wasn’t drownded, cause I had stole the boat. The wind it blew me
    right toward a great wall of rock where I knew I would be smashed to
    frogments, but Provdence, which watches over good men, directed the
    boat into a cave, where the water was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>smooth. I couldnt row out and
    if I stayed there I would starve, so I jest pulled further in. But
    the cave didnt have no end, and it was pitch dark. I kept on rowing
    for many days, maybe, till I see a light, and bime by I came out into
    a open sea again. The wall of rock was jest like it was on the other
    side where I went in, and seein that I couldnt climb it I steered for
    a island which I seen in the offing, and there I set my feets on tera
    firmly once more.</p>

  <p>“After offerin up thanks to the god of that country and makin a
    bountiful repast off a dead fish which lay on the beach describin
    itself with great loquacity in the language of flowers, I started
    inland for to find the natif niggers, but pretty soon I seen a sailor
    which had sea weed in his hair and eyes like them of the fish which I
    had et. I said: 'Hello, shipmate, what country is this?’</p>

  <p>“The feller he stared at me a long time out of his fish eyes, real
    spooky, and bime by he said: 'This is the Land of Drownded Sailors.’</p>

  <p>“Then I seen about a thousand million drownded sailors which I hadnt
    noticed, some like him and some worse. They all had sea weed in their
    hair and eyes like hisn, but some was black and some was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> yellow and
    some was white and some was French, and they all wore the clothes they
    was drownded in. They didnt say much, but they spoke in every tongue
    which is known to man, and Dutch too. Some was a playin cards, and some
    was a splicin ropes, and some was makin believe to scrub the decks, and
    some was a tattooin the others arms, and some was a carvin pictures
    on walrus teeths, and some was a fightin mity solemn to inattentive
    audiences, and every thing which sailor men do for to pass the time.
    When they see me they all knocked off work and arose up as one man and
    crowded around me and pointed their fingers at me, unmovin, like I was
    a show! And that is the awfulest thing which has ever befel me except
    bein born.”</p>

  <p>I asked Jack what did he do for to escape. Just then Uncle Ned, which
    had come in and heard the last part of the story, he spoke up and said,
    Uncle Ned did: “Johnny, you will have to excuse the witness, for he
    cant be compelled to say any thing which will disgrace him, so I will
    jest answer that question my own self. He escaped from them terrible
    fellers by lyin down and sleepin it off.” </p>

    <h3 id="DOMESTICAL_HENS">DOMESTICAL HENS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">HENS is good to eat, but not the old he ones, which is a fighter. They
    lay eggs and cackle. Some boys can cackle as good as a hen, but no
    eggs. Hens dont lay eggs on Sunday, but the minister he preaches. Billy
    says if the hens didnt lay eggs they would bust and if the minister
    didnt preach he would be sick. Our old hen she wanted for to set, but
    father he didnt, so he boiled a egg real hot and laid it in her nest.
    She went and straddled it and looked up at father like he was a fool.
    Then she shaked her self together and shut up her eyes and settled down
    to her work, much as to say: “You see I am a havin my way about this thing.”</p>

  <p>But pretty soon she gave a awful squok and jumped up and run round and
    round, like her head was cut off and she couldnt see her way. After
    that she was so afraid of eggs that when she couldnt help layin one she
    would run and fly, and some times the egg was lain in one place and
    some times it wasnt. One time she laid it on the roof of the church and
    it rolled off and busted on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> toomb stone close to where my father
    stood a talkin to old Gaffer Peters. Old Gaffer he looked up to the
    weather cock on the steeple and shook his head and said: “Ive been agin
    that dam thing from the first.”</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple he says a boy found some owl eggs and put them under a
    settin hen, cause they wasnt good for to suck. When they was hatched
    the old hen was mighty proud of them, like my mother is of Franky,
    thats the baby, but Mary, thats the house maid, she likes the butcher
    boy which brings the meat. One day the old rooster he said to the old
    hen: “Did you ever take notice what eyes them chicks of yourn has?”</p>

  <p>The old hen she said: “Yes, they look so wise I am afraid they arent
    long for this world, poor darlings.”</p>

  <p>The old rooster he shook his head and went away, but a other day he
    come back and said: “Them gum dasted chickens of yourn, which aint long
    for this world, are playin the old Nick while they stay. They jest
    now piled on to the yellow leg pullet and et her up in a minute, poor darlings.”</p>

  <p>The hen she thought a while, and then she said: “Thats a mighty good
    disposition for them to have, for they will protect me from owls.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

  <p>Then a other hen she spoke up and said: “Judgin from the looks of some
    folkses chicks I guess they aint so fraid of owls as they make believe.”</p>

  <p>But if I couldnt tell a better story than that I would teach school.</p>

  <p>One day a feller a plantin potatoes see a hawk a sittin on a hens nest
    and there was lots of feathers around, like a pillow had broke open.
    The feller he looked at the hawk a while, and then he said: “Well,
    Ile be gam doodled! You will make a nice mother for a brood of young
    chickens, wont you?”</p>

  <p>The hawk he said: “Well, what kind of a mother be you for a field of
    new potatoes?”</p>

  <p>Mister Jonnice, which has the wood leg, he says it was mighty
    thoughtful in the Creator to provide chickens for the hawks, but Uncle
    Ned he says it wasn’t quite so thoughtful in him to provide hawks for
    the chickens. One night when Mister Jonnice stayed to our house he hung
    his wood leg on the knob of his bed room door, out side, for to have
    fun with Mary, thats the house maid, cause his wood leg looks just like
    it was a meat one, only whiter. In the morning Mary she came to my
    mother and said: “O, if you please, mam, I guess the gent which slept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
    in the spare room cant get his door open, cause he is a comin out
    through the key hole.”</p>

  <p>A other time when Mister Jonnice was to our house Missis Doppy was here
    too, which has got the red head, you never seen any thing so red. When
    she had gone home Mister Jonnice he said: “If I was that womans husband
    Ide use her head for the parlor fier.”</p>

  <p>Then Missy, thats my sister, she spoke up and said: “I suppose you
    would use your leg for a back log.”</p>

  <p>One day Missis Doppy was here and stayed a long time, and bime by she
    went in my mothers bed room and was a combin her hair. Uncle Ned past
    the door and looked in, and then he came down stairs and said: “I guess
    she is a firin up to be off, I seen her a rakin out the cinders.”</p>

  <p>Mister Pitchel, thats the preacher, he says it is wicked to make fun of
    folkses miss fortunes, cause it is all for some wise purpose, and Uncle
    Ned he says yes, and Missis Doppys head is a mighty conspicus instance
    and a shiny xample.</p>

  <p>Hens is some time stole, and one time some wicked fellers which was
    in jail they kept a breakin out at night and stealin hens. So the man
    which kept the jail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> he said he would put a stop to that, and he had a
    other coat of paint put on the jail for to make it stronger. But the
    painter had put salt in the paint and the cows licked it off and the
    fellers broke out a again and stole more hens. That made the jail man
    mad and he said: “This aint no place for thiefs, and you fellers has
    got to behave your selfs or Ile put you out of here and you will have
    to rustle round for your livin the best way you can.”</p>

  <p>Roosters crow, but when there isnt any rooster the old hen she crows
    for to teach the little fellers how. But such crowin!—just like a
    sufferget hollerin hip, hip, hooray!</p>

  <p>My father he said to Mister Gipple, my father did: “I guess you and
    Johnnys Uncle Edard is mighty hard worked a tryin to see which can tell
    him the biggest lie. Maybe you better give your selfs a good long rest.”</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple he thought a while and then he said: “May I tell him jest
    one about my marriage in Africa, cause it is true?”</p>

  <p>My father he said: “O, you be dratted, I have knew Missis Gip ever
    since she was a little feller, and I know you married her in Illinoy.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

  <p>Mister Gipple said: “I hope to die if it isnt so, jest as I said.”</p>

  <p>Then my father he said: “All right, you may tell him, but I dont want
    to hear it, so Ile read this news paper.”</p>

  <p>So Mister Gipple told me for to come closer, so as not to interupt a
    man which was readin, and father he took out his spetacles and wiped
    them real careful, and put them on his nose, and begun for to read the
    paper just like he had never saw a other paper, only but just that one.
    Then Mister Gipple he said: “Johnny, one time while I was a missionary
    preacher in Africa I was mighty lonely and said to the king of the
    natif niggers: 'All you fellers is married, but I havnt got any, cause
    she is in Illinoy. Spose you let me have a wife too.’</p>

  <p>“The king he said: 'You aint nothing but a gum dasted white man, but
    you have been pretty decent about givin me rum and tobacco and showin
    me how to save my soul, so Ile give you all the wives that you can eat.’</p>

  <p>“I thanked him and went to my shack and lay down for to dream of
    conjuggle happiness, but about mid night I was awoke by a awful yellin
    and hammerin on gongs, and when I looked out the whole horizon was lit
    up with bon fires and I could see all the natif niggers a dancin and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
    carryin on like they was crazy drunk.</p>

  <p>“Next mornin I went to the king and asked him what was the trouble,
    and he said, the king did: 'No trouble at all, the high priest he
    married you last night and my loyal subjects was a cellebratin the
    nupitals. Every thing has been done proper, acordin to your station in
    life and you now have wives enough for to last a long time if you are
    economicle. There they are.’</p>

  <p>“Johnny, that bad man pointed to a cage of monkeys! Yes, my boy, they
    had made a gam doodled poligamer of me by marryin me to a lot of long
    tail, rib nose, jabberin apes and baboons. And me a piller of the
    Methody church in good standin! Johnny, my domestical life was unhappy,
    for I dont like monkey any way which it can be cooked.”</p>

  <p>Then my father he spoke up and said: “What did you do with them?”</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple he said: “Hello! aint there any news in that paper? I
    thought you was a great reader, which makes a man mighty wise. But if
    you want to know, I got a divorce on the ground of failure to provide.”</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

  <p>But if me and Billy was married to monkeys we would cumber the earth
    with heaps of slain, for the Constution it says man and wife are one
    flesh, which is grass.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE buf is found in all the big eastern cities. The she ones is called
    a cow cause she bellows loud and shrill, but the little one he is a
    sucker. The buflo is a natif of Omaha, but the peoples there they said:
    “O, whats the use, for the mooley cow is more milky and cant gore.”</p>

  <p>The buf has got a mane like a lions mane, but when he springs onto his
    prey and wrenches it from the earth the sheeps they laughf and say they
    could have done that thir own selfs.</p>

  <p>One time some soldiers they lay down in the prairie for to sleep. Their
    guide was a young feller which wore 3 revolvers and a big boy knife and
    had long yellow hair. In the middle of the night he was heard to holler
    like he was cats, cause some bufs had strayed in to camp for to eat
    grass, and thats what made the guide wish his self back in Boston. The
    captain of the soldiers he asked him what was up, and the guide said:
    “Some bodys gum dasted cow took me by the hair and swang me round till
    it pulled out, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>thats whats up!”</p>

  <p>The captain he said: “Well, what you kickin about? Animals which pulls
    up grass always has to shake the dirt off the roots, don’t they?”</p>

  <p>My sisters young man he says once there was a buf in the Zoo, and a
    Injin came for to see him. The buf he looked at the Injin, too, and
    bime by he said, the buf did: “How is the dusky chieftain of the
    Galoots, and how does it feel to wear the stopipe hat and frock coat of
    the Paleface?”</p>

  <p>The Injin he thought a while, and then he said: “If me and you was to
    home you would have some thing else to think about than the spring
    styles of gents cloes.”</p>

  <p>The buf he sighed and said: “The words of the great Swaller-His-Blanket
    brings back the light of other days most peculiar, the days when we
    roamed the plain together and you was always a little ahead.”</p>

  <p>The Injin spoke up and said: “Yes, events did move pretty rapid them
    days, but it wasn’t real progress like 20 dollars a week, for to do a
    scalp dance in a show.”</p>

  <p>The buf he wank his eye and said: “Ime fairly comfortable too, only
    but jest when I have a pain in the stomach of my belly from too much clover.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

  <p>But if I was a buflo I rather be a rain deer and gallop oer the snow
    beneath the aurory boryalis, hooray!</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he said: “Johnny, do you know how Mister Jonnice, which has
    the wood leg, lost his meat one?”</p>

  <p>I said: “Yessir, it was bit off by a cracky dile, and pulled out by a
    shark, and amptated for to cure the go out, and flang off when he ran
    after the fleein enemies at Gettysburg.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he said: “My boy, you have been listenin to him instead of
    consultin the best authoritys. Mister Jonnice was one time huntin
    bufloes in Wyoming, and he had slottered so many he was tired, so he
    lay down on a rock for to rest. Pretty soon a kioty came along, and the
    ki showed his teeths and said, ironicle: 'Lets hunt together.’</p>

  <p>“Mister Jonnice said: 'Ide like to, but the fact is Ime about to go
    away, a leavin you so far behind that we cant.’</p>

  <p>“Then Mister Jonnice he departed, mighty awkward but surprisin fast,
    and disapeared over the horizon. The ki he looked a while, and then he
    said: 'All right, if I cant get what I want Ile take what I can get,
    and a half of a loaf is better than nothing to eat.’</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

  <p>“So the ki it et Mister Jonnices leg every little tiny bit up.</p>

  <p>“You see, Johnny, when the convsation began the leg was asleep, and
    Mister Jonnice hadnt time for to wake it up, but bein a brave man he
    had hopped away without it.”</p>

  <p>But the zeebry is the swiftest thing which is in the world, and the hi
    potamus roars like he was a brigdier general, and then the rhi nosey
    rose winks his eye, much as to say: “Hark, I hear a angel sing.” </p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE he sheep is a ram and the she is a you and the little feller is
    lambs. Lambs is playful, and when the sun is shinin warm in the spring
    they turn out and have a stunnin good time, and thats why The Bible it
    says for to go it while you are young. When a sheep has been sheared
    it doesnt look very civilized, more like it was sick. Mister Gipple
    says one time a scientifical feller he surprised a young you which had
    been sheared the first time, and she blushed so rosy that he wrote to
    the presdent of his college: “I have discovered a new specie of red
    dog, which I have named <i>Canis rubicutis</i>, make me a professor
    of animals, with a salary of one thousand hundred dollars a year and
    board.” But my sister she can turn real red too when I tell her that
    bitin her young man isnt fair play.</p>

  <p>A old you she had a labm, and one day she was sheared. When the labm it
    came to her for to get its dinner it stopped and looked at her a while,
    and then it backed away and made a bow, much as to say: “I beg your
    pardon, I didnt know you was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> that way. I will wait.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he said to my sister: “Missy, I have some mighty bad news for
    you, but you must brace up and try for to bear it. Me and Mister Gipple
    was out in the country yester day, and we caught your young man eatin a
    dead sheep.”</p>

  <p>Missy she most fainted, and she said: “You wicked man, it isnt so,
    where was it?”</p>

  <p>Then Uncle Ned he said, Uncle Ned did: “It was in the dining room of a
    way side inn.”</p>

  <p>I never have see such a furious girl like Missy was, but Uncle Ned he
    says every woman is a fo to the truth and I better be ware how I tell
    it.</p>

  <p>Dead sheeps is mutton, but canibles eat their selves and is happy. When
    Jack Brily was casted a way on a island he seen 2 canibles meet, and
    one said to the other how did he do, and the other he said: “O, Ime
    jest fine—fit for to set before a king.”</p>

  <p>A other time Jack was ship wreck, and him and the captain was threw on
    a bare rock, where they came near starvin to death. So they drawed lots
    to see which one should be et by the other, and the captain he lost.
    Then he said, the captain <span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>did: “Well, my man, you didnt think me and
    you would ever be mess mates, did you?”</p>

  <p>Jack he said: “No sir, I sure didnt expect sech a honor as to meet you
    at dinner, and the worst of it is that I havnt my ditty bag and cant
    slick my self up a bit.”</p>

  <p>There was a old ram which licked all the other rams which are in the
    world, so one day a feller which the old ram had licked hisn he see him
    comin, and he took a big lookin glass, the feller did, and set it up
    on the river bank long side the road. The ram he see it and shook his
    head and said: “You gum dasted homely galoot, if you think you can hide
    behind that picture frame you are mistook.”</p>

  <p>So he backed off and let drive like he was shot out of a cannon and
    busted through the lookin glass and went down in to the river. Bime by
    he was washed a shore and stood up on his feets with the cold water a
    runnin out of his wool, like he was a spunge. Then he shet up his eyes
    for to think, cause he was all mixed up in his mind, and bime by he
    said, real thoughtful: “Braveness is the soldiers hope. I wont never
    again hide behind a picture frame for to sass a other feller which is
    goin a long the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> a mindin his own business.”</p>

  <p>Missis Doppy she says her little Sammy is a labm, but I dont see no
    wool, nothing only but just dirt. One day Sammy tore his trousers,
    which was brown, and she put a blue patch on the place. Pretty soon
    after she and him was to our house, and my father he said: “Missis
    Doppy, that is a mighty fine boy of yourn.”</p>

  <p>Missis Doppy was real pleased, and she said: “Yes, indeed, he is just a
    little angel right down from Heaven.”</p>

  <p>My father he smoked his pipe in silents for a while, then he said:
    “That little angel of yourn seems to have brought a piece of the sky
    down with him.”</p>

  <p>You never seen such a furious woman as Missis Doppy was in your life,
    and Billy didn’t in hisn, but the Bible it says we shouldnt ever let
    our hungry passions arise, cause them which takes up the sword shall be
    for ever exalted.</p>

  <p>Labms is so famous that they have statutes in all the grave yards, just
    like soldiers in Washington, and now I will tell you a story which my
    sisters young man told me.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

  <p>One time General Grant, which was the greatest man in the world, was
    a bein showed the statutes which adorn the city of Washinton, and he
    said, General Grant did: “I never seen such a lot of gam doodled scare
    crows!”</p>

  <p>Then a good man which was a preacher he spoke up and said: “General,
    you oughtnt to swear, cause the wicked shall be casted in to Hell.”</p>

  <p>The General he said: “Thank you, I shouldnt mind that so very much, but
    I sure dont want to be casted in to bronze.”</p>

  <p>Statutes is made by sculptors, and thats why I say every creepin thing
    brings 4th after its own kind and multiplies excessive.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">I&nbsp;SAID did Uncle Ned know what makes water run off a ducks back, and he
    said: “Yes, my boy, thats about the only thing that I am prepaired for
    to take a examnation on with out cribbin from the tex book. One time in
    the garden of Eden, Adam, which was takin home a bucket of coal oil,
    see the frog a sittin a sleep in the grass, and then he see the duck.
    The duck it snook up and pecked the frog real cruel on the spine of
    its back. If you catch a frog you will see the hump where its back was
    broke.</p>

  <p>“Adam he said: 'You gum dasted beast of the field, why did you do that?’</p>

  <p>“The duck tost its head contemptible and sed: 'Cause he makes me tired,
    he is so disgustin clean, always takin a bath.’</p>

  <p>“Adam said: 'Dont you ever take a bath your own self?’</p>

  <p>“The duck it said: 'No, I dont, cause cleanity is only but jest a
    habit, and water is pizen.’</p>

  <p>“That made Adam so mad that he flang the whole bucket of oil on the
    duck, which smelt awful and has been aquaticle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> ever since. It swims
    and dives and splashes all the life long day for to wash the oil off,
    but the water wont take hold.”</p>

  <p>I said why didnt the ducks wash their selfs with soap, but Uncle Ned he
    shook his head real mournful and said: “No, no, I have suggested that
    reform to them many a time and oft, but the march of mind is mighty
    slow in this world and, so far, they wont do any thing only but just
    eat the soap.”</p>

  <p>Ducks quack and the eagle he screams, and the high eany it laughfs when
    there isnt any thing funny, the cammel he snorts out of his nose and
    Franky, thats the baby, he gets soap in his eye and is like the battles
    roar! Frankys eyes is blue, but my sisters young mans is gray, and when
    she looks into hisn he looks into hern. And thats why I say how wondful
    are the works of Provdence!</p>

  <p>One day when him and her was to the picture gally she seen one which
    she liked real well and she said: “Isnt that a duck of a paintin?”</p>

  <p>Then he said: “Yes, indeed, I seen the other side of it. It is a canvas
    back.”</p>

  <p>But Uncle Ned says if he couldn’t make better jokes than that he would
    write for the comicle papers and defy detecktion!</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

  <p>Mister Jonnice, which has the wood leg, he says one time he went to New
    Jersey for to be an editor of a comicle paper, and the second day a
    feller came in the office, wearin a long black coat and lookin like his
    heart was broke. He said good mornin mighty solemn and Mister Jonnice
    he said: “Welcome to the Temple of Meriment, cheer up and have a chair,
    hows buisness?”</p>

  <p>The feller he said: “That depends a good deal on you.”</p>

  <p>Mister Jonnice he spoke up a other time and said: “All right, Ile
    go home and ring the neck of my little girl and pizen my wife and
    discumbowel my father.”</p>

  <p>The sollemn feller said: “You fill me with horrible! I beg you for to
    pawse and consider what a wicked thing that would be to do.”</p>

  <p>Then Mister Jonnice he thought a while and bime by he said, soft and
    low: “Yes, I guess maybe it might be looked at that way, and I wouldnt
    do sech things only but for to help you.”</p>

  <p>The feller he looked like he didnt under stand, then he said, the
    feller did: “Excuse me if I seem hard for to please, but how would them
    actions help me?”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

  <p>Mister Jonnice said: “Why, aint you a a under taker?”</p>

  <p>The feller he looked mournfuller than ever and said: “Alas, no, I am
    Rollickin Ralf, your chief contributer. God willin, me and you will
    make the Temple resound with gle.”</p>

  <p>The Bible it says thou shall not kill, cause them which is killed they

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">MISTER GIPPLE he said: “Johnny, di ever tell you about the numporaucus?”</p>

  <p>I said he didnt, and then he said: “The nump is by many considered the
    king of beasts, for its roar is like the voice of doom, and when it is
    heard at midnights holy hour the heathen in his blindness says he must
    put up a lightnin rod first thing in the mornin. But when the day dawns
    bright and fair like a angels face he knows it was only just the nump
    a talkin in his sleep. Johnny, as you justly say, the cracky dile is a
    microbe and the skin of the rhi nosey rose isnt made to measure, but
    the nump is a one legger and skowers the plane like a thing of life.”</p>

  <p>I said where was it found, and he said, Mister Gipple did: “There is a
    dispute about that among scientificle fellers, cause no body which has
    found a nump has come back for to tell the tale. Some believes it to
    inhabbit the equator, but others say it is a scallywag. The one which I
    seen was in New Jersey, where I was a missonary to the natif niggers.
    One day I catched a natif<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> and was a lickin him for bowin down to wood
    and stone, when a big black shadow fel a thwort the scene of spiritual
    contversy. With a few well choosen words I brought the services to
    a close and looked up for to pronounce the bennediction and there,
    between me and the noondy sun towered a giant numporaucus! It was as
    big as a house of the same size and its eye was as the full moon when
    lovers whisper their vows of ever lastingness.</p>

  <p>“Johnny, I was mighty scary for a man which was married and had met
    the lightnin eye to eye quite frequent, and I couldnt think of a word
    to say. The nump it stood on its lonely leg and looked at me a while,
    mighty reticent, and then it stept forward and took my neck between
    its teeths and I knew no more! When consience returned I was in my
    own country, a runnin for office, to which I had the bad luck to be
    defeated by a over weening majority.</p>

  <p>“The years rolled on and one day I read in the paper that on the polmy
    plains of New Jersey a skulleton had been found with its neck bit
    in 2! A natif niger which would carry to his grave the marks of his
    conversion to the Bible was asked what he knew about it. He wank his
    eye mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> mournful, much as to say he could tell a good deal more if
    he wanted to, and I guess he could, for he was a dandy talker and had
    arose to high distincktion in the church.”</p>

  <p>I asked Mister Gipple who the natif nigger was and he said: “Never mind
    that, Johnny, for it doesnt matter much. What worries me is who I am my
    own self.”</p>

  <p>But if me and Billy met a nump we would fall up on him with fire and
    sword and strech him dead up on the plain! The Bible it says to resist
    evil and it will fle as a bird, and thats why I say be up and doin, for
    the sluggerd goes to the ant and is bit.</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple says that one time Mister Jonnice, which has the wood
    leg, was a sittin by the road side in the Cannible Island and a big
    natif nigger came a long with nothing on but a stopipe hat. The stumach
    of the natif niggers belly it stuck out be fore him, real round, and
    he was a drummin on it with his 2 hands, mighty cumftable. When he see
    Mister Jonnice he stopt and looked at him a while, and then he said:
    “Poor feller, you seem to have lost your laig.”</p>

  <p>Mister Jonnice he spoke up and said: “Yessir, and you seem for to have
    found it and et it.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

  <p>My sisters young man says if he had a wood leg he would take it to a
    massadger and tell him to put some ginger in to it.</p>

    the mole. I can only lay it to your ignance, cause maybe you don’t know
    there is such a feller.”</p>

  <p>Then I spoke up and said: “The mole is amphibious and lives in the
    ground. It hasent got any eyes, but its nose is like a awger, cause
    it can bore through the solid rock and come out on the other side and
    holler hooray! The fur of the mole is slick and shiny and makes good
    mufs. Girls wears mufs but boys is kings and can stand on their head.
    Girls is cry babys, and if I was a girl I rather be a fellers wife and
    roar like distant thunder.”</p>

  <p>Then Uncle Ned he said: “Johnny, I see that I was mistook. You are not
    ignant about moles, and you are mighty well informed about girls. My
    charge of indifference arose out of the fact that you never asked me
    why the mole doesnt come out of the ground for to bask in the light
    of day and survey mankind with comperhensive view. I should think a
    bright, scientificle boy like you would want to know that, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>same as to
    learn why the beaver has a flat tail, and how the cammle got his hunch
    and what makes the buttigoat have whiskers.”</p>

  <p>I asked him why was it, and he said: “Thats what I knocked off work a
    plantin potatoes, to come in and tell you, for knowlidge is power.</p>

  <p>“One time Adam he was a diggin post holes in the Garden of Eden,
    when the mole it come along and said good mornin, cause the mole it
    was created real sociable. Adam he was grouchy, cause Eve had sassed
    him, and he dident say any thing. Then the mole said: 'If I was give

  <p>“That made Adam furious, like he was a wet cat, and he said: 'I dont
    want advice from any gun dasted squirel of the air.’ So he catched the
    mole and flang it in to the post hole which he had dugged, and said:
    'Ile be gam doodled if I dont burry you alive for your impidence!’</p>

  <p>“Then he begun for to fill up the hole, and the mole it spoke up real
    solemn and said: 'Ime laid here in the shure and certain hope of a
    blessed resuraction.’</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

  <p>“But Adam he said: 'That hope will be blasted. You shant ever arise
    from the dead till Gabrial blows his horn and eccho ansers from the
    hill.’</p>

  <p>“And, Johnny, thats why the mole, which tils the soil real industrious,
    never comes up for to view the land scape oer.”</p>

  <p>One day Billy he come home a holdin up a mole by the tail, which some
    boy had give him, and the mole it was a live.</p>

  <p>When my mother she see him she said: “O you cruel, cruel boy! Throw it
    in the fire this minute!”</p>

  <p>One Sunday Mister Pitchel, thats the preacher, he was to our house, and
    mother she read out of a paper about Doctor Tanner, which didn’t eat
    any thing for 40 days, and she said, mother did: “Stuff and non sense,
    he would have died.”</p>

  <p>Father he said: “I dont know about that. Bears stay in hollow trees all
    winter and live by suckin their feets.”</p>

  <p>Mister Pitchel he thought a while, and bime by he looked up at the
    ceilin a while, real sollemn, and then he said: “There was a greater
    than Docktor Tanner, and He fasted forty days and forty nights in the
    wildness. Does any of you know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> it was which sustained Him?”</p>

  <p>Then Billy he spoke up real quick and said: “Sucked his feets!” </p>

    <h3 id="THE_GOFURIOUS">THE GOFURIOUS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE GOFURIOUS is the monarck of the mountains, and Uncle Ned he says
    its roar is like ocean on a western beach. The go rises with the lark,
    and when he shakes hisself the stars shoots madly from their spheres!
    But the rhi nosey rose looks up from his dinner and says: “Nothin doin.”</p>

  <p>One day a rhi met a go and the go it said: “If I had such a potuberence
    on my nose like that Ide wear a vail.”</p>

  <p>The rhi he thought a while and then he said, the rhi did: “Some folks
    has horns on their noses and some others is gum dasted iddiots, its all
    a matter of taste. I know I aint beautifle for to look at, but this
    sticker of mine is mighty handy for to search the innards of the sick,
    and I guess you aint a feelin very well this mornin, are you?”</p>

  <p>Then the go it moved away and sed it thought maybe it better take a
    pill.</p>

  <p>The gofurious is a natif of the equator, which it devastates from pole
    to pole! Its food is niggers, and it is the joy of its sweet young life
    to stain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> it plumadge with their gore! The she one is called a scow,
    but the little feller is a slob. The old he one has got three horns,
    one on its neck, and one on its back, and a little sharp one on its
    tail, and when it is poked it whacks this one in to the poke feller,
    which turns purple and swells up like he was a baloon and xplodes with
    a loud report.</p>

  <p>Sheeps is carnivories, and the tagger it is a mollusk, but the go has
    got a white belly and only but just one leg, which is like a blasted
    pine and defies the storm! Its lonely foot is like the talent of a
    eagle, and when it skowers the desert so much dust is threw up that the
    natif niggers cant see which way to run, so the go catches them and
    they perish in their pride. When the go sees a hi potamus it gnashes
    its teeths once, twice, thrice, and raises a protestin voice. The hi
    he says he guesses he knows his own business and aint a goin to knock
    off bein a hi potamus for any snouty galoot which roams the plain. But
    the go envelps him in a cloud of dust and clasps him to its bosum, and
    when the weather clears up the hi is no more! Then the go it utters a
    long mournful wail, much as to say: “Alas, am I doomed never to know
    the pleashures of a peaceful life? <span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>Why am I cursed with a unsociable
    disposition?”</p>

  <p>When my sisters young man had read about the go, and the hi, and
    evrything, he said: “Johnny, I wonder, O, I wonder how did them facts
    become known to you. Can it be possible that you inherit them from your
    gifted uncle?”</p>

  <p>I said, “Yes, I did.” Then he said: “Well, well, well, who would have
    thought it? This is the worst case of trance mission which I have ever
    knew about. Yes, indeed, it beats the ever lastin Dutch!”</p>

  <p>Some folkes bears false witness, but Uncle Ned he knows every thing
    which is in the world, and he is increddible.</p>

    <h3 id="THE_RHI_NOSEY_ROSE">THE RHI NOSEY ROSE</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">MY father he told me why didnt I write about the unicorn. I said I
    would, so I set down and wrote about its 1 horn, and how it had a mane
    like horses, and how it stood on its hind feets for to fight lions, and
    every thing I could think of, but when I come to its tail I said did it
    have a tassel. Then my father he said: “If you have got to the end of
    your subject why dont you stop?”</p>

  <p>But my sisters young man says the unicorn is nothing only but just a
    rhi nosey rose. Pretty soon after that Uncle Ned he said: “Johnny, I
    know you are just dyin for to know something about the rhi nosey rose.”</p>

  <p>Then I spoke up and said: “The rhi nosey rose is the most powful beast
    which is known to man. He is found in the jingles of the Nile, but the
    feller which finds him is lost his own self, for ever and ever, amen.
    The rhi is a 4 legger and gamles oer the green with whirl wind speed to
    catch the natif nigger as he flies afar. But the travler meets him eye
    to eye and fels him to the plain and writes a book about it. The lion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
    roars like distant thunder, the gorillys song is as the wind among the
    pines, the long lament of the hi potamus is mournful for to hear, and
    the harpsicord cracky dile sobs out his heart on the evenin blast, but
    the rhi nosey rose hasn’t a word to say. He is all buisness.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned said: “My boy, you are eloquenter than preachin, and I have
    listened to your perioration with delight and profit cause I know that
    them gloing periods come straight from the heart of your sisters young
    man, which wrote them for you. Cherish him, Johnny, cherish him as the
    apple of your eye, for he is a realy genuine bombastic, but when it
    comes to rhi nosey roses he isnt in it with your uncle Edard, not by a
    heap! Frexample, can he tell you how the rhi came to have a horn on his
    nose? I trow not.”</p>

  <p>I asked how it was, and he said: “When the distinguished naturaler
    which you have just quoted wrote about the lions roar, and the gorillys
    song, and the quiring of the flopdoodle, and so 4th, he was mighty
    close to a great discuvery, but he missed it pretty slick. One day in
    the Garden of Eden them fellers was a showin off their voices, and it
    made the rhi feel mighty lonely.” So he said to Adam: “If you please,
    sir, Ide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> like for to be frightful my self.”</p>

  <p>Adam said: “Well, you aint particlarly reassurin to them which has good
    eye sight, as you are, but come to me to-morrow and we will see what
    can be done.”</p>

  <p>That night, while the rhi was a sleep, Adam made a big horn grow on the
    rhi, and when the rhi came next day he said, Adam did: “Now you can be
    just as alarmin to the blind as them other chaps. All you got to do is
    to blow your horn.”</p>

  <p>“Johnny, when you go to the zoo and see the rhi a liftin up his lip
    and twistin it round in such a awfle way dont you be afraid, cos he
    is only just a tryin for to blow his horn to beat the resoudin lion,
    put to shame the deafening hyena and parolyze with envy the hoo-hooing
    rhododandrum. He dont always succeed, but if you go frequent you will
    some day be rewarded with a blast which will make the heavens be mute.”</p>

  <p>I asked Uncle Ned what makes the snale have a shell always on his back,
    and he said: “It dident use to be so. The snale was created all right,
    but it sought out many inventions and told them without turnin a hair.
    One day Adam he seen the snale creepin along the gravel walk, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
    said, Adam did: 'You lazy worm of the dust, why don’t you get a move on
    you?’</p>

  <p>“The snale it said: 'Ime the swiftest quodped which flies a long
    the plain, when I try. I devours distance like it was a string of
    maccarony, and there is only a imadginary line between the place where
    I am and the place where I want to be. I over take the kangaroon as he
    flies for his life, and the pigeon in the sky weeps to see me vanish
    below his horizon. When I go west it is always the same time of day
    with me, but when I turn east it is mid night before I have took a half
    dozen jumps.’</p>

  <p>“Adam said: 'My, but you are spry when you are in a hurry. I spose you
    aint goin any where in particklar today.’</p>

  <p>“The snale it said: 'Ime sick today, and have jest dragged my self out
    of the house for to get a breath of fresh air.’</p>

  <p>“Adam he said: 'Where do you live, when you are to home?’ and the snale
    said: 'In that curly house away over there on the other side of the
    gravel walk.’</p>

  <p>“Adam he thought a while, and bime by he said: 'It would be a great
    pity if the swiftest quodped which skowers the plain should take cold
    and die. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> just go right in to your house again, and dont you leave
    it till I tell you.’</p>

  <p>“Then Adam he walked a way and wank his eye, to his self and said: 'I
    have such a bad remember, may be Ile forget to tell him.’</p>

  <p>“Johnny, that’s just what happened, so the fool snale, bein forbid to
    leave his house, has to take it along with him where ever he goes. And
    that will teach you never to brag about what you can do if you cant do
    it.”</p>

  <p>But if Adam would scold me and Billy we would say: “You bad old man,
    what for did you eat that apple and make us all go to Sunday school?”</p>

  <p>But a apple dumplin, plenty sugar on it, is as musicle as Apoloes loot.</p>

  <p>In Madgigascar the natif niggers build their houses on the tops of
    posts for to keep the snakes out, and one day 2 natifs was a settin
    on the floor playin cards, and a rhi nosey rose he had gone under
    the house. Then he stuck his horn up through the floor between the
    niggerses legs. One of them said: “Whats that?”</p>

  <p>But the other feller, which had just played a card, and was a studdyin
    his hand, and didnt see the horn, and he said: “You know what it is
    well enough, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>have you got any thing to beat it? Thats the question.”</p>

  <p>The other feller said he didnt believe he had, and arose his self up
    and jumped out of the window. Then the rhi walked away with the house
    on his head, and you never have saw such a astonish feller as the one
    which was a studdyin his hand!</p>

  <p>When the rhi meets the ephalent he roots him with his sticker in the
    stumach of the belly, like the rhi was a hog, and the eph he wollups
    the rhi with his proboscus, like beatin a carpet for to get the dust
    out. My picture book it says that when the rhi has got the eph on his
    sticker the ephs grease runs in to the rhis eyes and puts them out. I
    asked Mister Gipple, which has been in Africa, if that was so. Mister
    Gip he thought a while, and bime by he said: “Yes, that was true a long
    while ago, but one day the rhi nosey roses they held a public meetin
    to see if something couldnt be done about it. There was a hundred ways
    pointed out for to stop it, but all them which had the best plans
    and made the longest speeches was the blind fellers. Bime by a old
    rhi which hadnt said any thing he rose hisself up and said: 'Mister
    chairman, I have give this matter much atention, and while I aint sure
    that the trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> can be untirely stopped, I think mebby some thing
    might be done toward it by keepin away from the ephalents.’</p>

  <p>“Then they all rised in wrath and gored him with their stickers, and
    put him out, cause they said this was a pratticle matter and they didnt
    want nobodys fine spun theories.</p>

  <p>“After a while a rhi which had been away he come in and asked what was
    the objek of the meetin, and when he was told he spoke up and said:
    'You gam doodled idiots, why dont you stickum in the back? Grease don’t
    run up hill.’</p>

  <p>“Then they all hollered: 'Hooray! thats jest what we was a goin to say
    our selfs. We will make this feller our king!’</p>

  <p>“So they put a gold crown on his head, and give him a jacknife with 4
    blades, and a kite, and a peg top, and some fire crackers, and all the
    candy which he could eat.</p>

  <p>“And now, Johnny, Ile tell you a other. One time a rhi it got mired
    in the mud of the Nile, which had overflew its banks, and the rhi was
    about to be drownded in the water. While he was thinkin of all the
    sins which he done, how he had gored the poor little hi potamuses, and
    trampled down the niggerses corn, and hadnt looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span> like the pictures
    on the circus posters, and every thing naughty, there was a cammel.
    Then the rhi he hollered: 'Bully for you! I thought no body would come
    along, but I see that the righteous is never forsook.’</p>

  <p>“The cammel he looked a while, real solemn out of his eyes, as you so
    graphicle say, and then he said: 'What special advantage do you promise
    your self from my knowin that there is the remains of a rhi nosey rose
    under the mud of this river?’</p>

  <p>“The rhi he seen the cammel wasnt a goin for to do anything for him, so
    he said: 'I don’t care what you know, nor what you dont know, but when
    a feller is departin this life he goes more willin and lamb like if he
    sees at his bed side one of them objeks which makes life so everlasty
    disgustin.’”</p>

  <p>But if I was a rhi nosey rose I rather be a eagle, cause the eag is
    the umblem of the land of the free, and has the stars and strips
    embludgeoned on his breast! </p>

    <h3 id="SWANS">SWANS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">A MAN which had a swan his boy was home from colledge, and one day the
    boy he come in with a gun and said, the boy did: “A awfle big snake
    stuck its head up out of the grass in the pond in the lawn, and I knew
    it was a lookin for your swan, for to bite it, so I shot it, now give
    me some spendin money, cause I saved your swan.”</p>

  <p>But it was the swans neck which he had shot, and his father said: “I
    sent you to Yale for to learn what swans is, and now I got to send you
    to Harverd for to learn what snakes is, and fore you know every thing
    its a goin to mighty xpensive to your poor old father.”</p>

  <p>Little swans is signets and my sisters young man he says their tracks
    in the mud is their signetures, but that isent so, cause signetures is
    writtin “Johnny” real plain on a piece of paper and showin it to your
    mother.</p>

  <p>Today while Uncle Ned was in the parlor my mother she come in and said:
    “Edard, since Johnny took to writin them animal stories, and you took
    to sendin them to that nasty news paper, we havent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> been any thing but
    just a famly of jokers, like we was clowns in circusses, and you have
    been the head of it all. I blieve every body in town is a laughfin at
    us. If you havnt got any self respeck for your own self you ought to
    have some for me and your niece.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he got up and put his hand in his waist coat and bowed and
    said, real sollemn: “The subjeck on which I have had the honor to
    be addressed is of national importance, and one in which I take the
    deepest intrest, and I thank the delegation for the able manner in
    which it has been presented. Appreciatin the dificultys of my position,
    you will not xpect me to say more at present, but I can ashure you that
    what it has been my privlege to hear shall be submited to my colleags
    and will recieve the most atentif considderation.”</p>

  <p>My mother she was astonish, like Uncle Ned was out of his head, and
    she looked at him a while, and then she walked slow out of the room,
    a sayin: “Well, I never!” But the minute the door was shut Uncle Ned
    he said: “Quick, Johnny, jump to your work, once there was a dog, or
    a horse, or a hipporaucus, or a 3 leg rammidoodle, or any thing which
    you can think of, theres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> your paper and heres a pencil, spring, I tell
    you, look alive!”</p>

  <p>But I was so xcited that I couldent think of any thing for to write, so
    I jest busted out a cryin, and Uncle Ned said: “One time there was a
    weepin willow.”</p>

  <p>About a hour after wards my mother, which was a knittin, she looked up
    and said: “Edard, why is a ephalent like a man which is a goin on a
    jurney?”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned, which was a readin a book, he shut it up, and stood up on
    his feets, and then he laid it away, and walked over to where my mother
    was, and looked her in the face and pretty soon he fetched 3 chairs and
    set them before her, and she said: “What do you mean, Edard, I have
    never seen such actions.”</p>

  <p>But Uncle Ned he went and got Billy, and set him in one of the chairs,
    and then he put me in a other, and give me a pencil and a piece of
    paper. Then he set his self down in the other chair, and Bildad, thats
    the new dog, it come and set down long side of Billy. After we was all
    put, and nobody had spoke, cause me and Billy thought it was some game
    which was to be played, Uncle Ned he looked at mother and said: “I give
    it up, now for the answer. Be sure you get it right, Johnny.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

  <p>But my mother she was a gettin redder and redder, like beets, and bime
    by she got up and flounced out of the room, furiouser than any thing
    which I have ever saw in all my life, or Billy ever seen in hisn. There
    was never such a dizzy pointed man as Uncle Ned was, but he says they
    are all just that way, in Indy and every where.</p>

    <h3 id="THE_HIPPORIPPUS">THE HIPPORIPPUS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">MISTER GIPPLE, which has been in Africa, he said: “Johnny, if your
    ungennerous kinsman hadent saw fit for to impeech my credibility,
    which is the most precious juel in my crown, Ide tell you about the
    hipporippus.”</p>

  <p>I said what was it like, and he said: “It is a little like a ephalent,
    cause it has got teeths mighty plain to see, and a little like a
    cammel, cause it has got a back, and a little like a giraft, cause it
    has got a neck, and a little like a jackus, cause its voice is heard
    in the stilly night, and a little like a man, cause it is pizen. It is
    a off spring of the thunder and the grave, and is distant related to
    the surf beat shore. When it winks a black shadow sweeps across the
    face of the world, and when it opens its eye again light breaks upon
    the land scope like dawn over the eastern hills. It walks a merridian
    of longitude and, lo, the east is parted from the west for to make
    room! It laughfs in fiendish glee and the milk sours in the cows of all
    nations. Yet this tempestilent creature can be as gentle as a suckin
    whirl pool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span> and coo like laughture in a toomb.”</p>

  <p>I asked where was the hip found. Mister Gipple thought a while, and
    bime by he said: “A contented mind is better than great riches, but
    if you cant smuther your curosity you may look for it just out side
    the scruburbs of most any Afcan village, for it is mighty sociable and
    loves the fellership and communion of yuman beings better than pie. But
    when you go for to find the hip you better empty your pockets of your
    marbles, and your peg top, and your kite string, and your jack knife,
    and your base ball, and your 12 inches of rusty chain, or you will know
    them no more for ever.”</p>

  <p>I said would the hip take them away from me, and he said: “No, it wont,
    it will take you away from them.”</p>

  <p>But if I met a hip I would roll my sleefs up, and spit on my hands, and
    thunder: “You cowerdly feller, if you come a step nearer I will go home
    and tell my father!”</p>

  <p>And thats why I say courage is the stuff of life, and none but the
    brave deserts the fair!</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple says one time Mister Pitchel, thats the preacher, was a
    mitionary in Africa, like he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> his self, and he converted all the
    peoples in a town, and they jest doted on him. But one night a natif
    nigger snook in to Mister Pitchels hut and said, the natif nigger did,
    “You better leave here mighty quick, for they are a goin to boil you.”</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple, which was astonish, he said: “I guess there is a
    mistake, cause Ime so popular.”</p>

  <p>The natif nigger he said: “Thats jest the reason, for they say you are
    a saint and it would bring a blessin to the town for to have a few of
    your rellics, jest your shin bones, and a half dozzen of the nuckles of
    the spine of your back, and maybe the skull of your head.”</p>

  <p>I asked Mister Gipple if them rellics of Mister Pitchel, would have
    done any good, and he said: “Well, Johnny, not bein a church feller,
    Ime not shure about it, and Ime particklar scepticle about the head,
    seein it has never done him any good his own self, but them shin bones
    surely did work a mirracle when he was a pullin out of that town.”</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple says there was a other mitionary preacher, and he had
    only but just one leg, like Mister Jonnice. One day the king of the
    cannibals asked him to dinner. So he slicked his self up and went. The
    king said: “Ime glad to see you, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> take your close off.”</p>

  <p>The 1 legger he said: “Yessir, I see Ime not in the fashion, but I
    thought you would be indulgent to a benighted forreign feller which is
    your guest at dinner.”</p>

  <p>The king he spoke up and said: “You dont seem for to under stand. You
    are the dinner.”</p>

  <p>The one legger he seen how it was, but he smiled real polite and said:
    “O, I beg pardon, how many of you are to eat me?”</p>

  <p>The king said there was 2, countin the dog which was to be give the
    bones. Then the mitionary said what was the choice parts of a feller
    like him, and the king said: “You chaps is like frogs. Unless fammin
    stalks abroad in the land we dont care for anything you have only but
    just the hind legs.”</p>

  <p>The mitionary said: “Ime mighty glad for to hear you say so, cause Ide
    like to keep my head a while. I need it in my business. Here is one
    of my hind legs, which will last you till midnights holy hour, and to
    morrow I will bring you the other.”</p>

  <p>So he reached under the table and took off his cork laig and laid it
    fore the king, which was so rattled that fore he knew what to do the
    mitionary had hopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> away.</p>

  <p>Mister Jonnice says when he gets rich he is a goin to buy a leg of
    sandal wood with the sandal on it, but I say blessed is the poor, for

  <p class="drop-cap">A FELLER was a ridin one, and every little while it would stop and
    bray. The feller he said: “For goodness sake, dont be 2 nusances to
    once. If you are a goin to sing you must trot along same time, but if
    you prefer to stop you got to hold your tongue. Ime a long way from
    home, and my wife is lyin at the point of death, and night is comin on,
    and I havent had my supper, but tween you and me I dont care which plan
    you adopt.”</p>

  <p>One day when my father was in Nevady he met a Cornish miner comin up
    the grade to Virgina City, carryin a jackus on his shoulders, and my
    father he said: “Poor little animal! What broke its leg?”</p>

  <p>The miner he said: “Ta blessit moke have luggit I all ta way from Reno,
    and I be givin he a bit of a rest fore ridin in to town, thats what
    brakit uns lag.”</p>

  <p>Old Gaffer Peters has got a son which was a sailer, like Jack Brily,
    and the boy stopped in Spain and got married. One time he wrote to old
    Gaffer and sent the letter to my father for to be give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> him, but my
    father opened it his self, cause he thought it was hisn. The letter had
    a photy grap in it of old Graffers little grand son. But my sisters
    young man he snook out the picter and put in a other one, which was
    a baby with the head of a jackus. My father he dident know, and he
    give the letter to old Gaffer, which looked at the picter, and then
    read the letter, and then thought a while real sollemn, and bime by he
    said: “When a young feller makes a fool of his self and marrys a wild
    Spainard his boys dont look like his home folks one bit.”</p>

  <p>But father he said: “Why, Gaffer, I never see such a spekin likeness as
    that pictur is of you.”</p>

  <p>Old Gaffer he put his spettacles on again and looked at it a other
    time, real long, and then he shook his head and said: “Ole age is
    onorable, but it makes a feller look like a dam rabbit!”</p>

  <p>Jackusses looks like mules, and Franky, thats the baby, looks like he
    would bust, and Missy she looks at her young man, and says to her self:
    “How nice!”</p>

  <p>But if she had saw him when he wank his eye at Mary, thats the
    house maid, she wouldnt think so, for winkin is pligamy and thats
    trigonomatry.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

  <p>I ast Uncle Ned did he know what makes the Jackus bray, and he said:
    “Yes, I do. In the Garden of Eden Adam had a field of barly, and he
    told the animals that if they didnt keep out of it he would cast them
    all in to a lake of ever lastin fire. Now the jackuses tail was created
    up right, like it was the mast of a ship, so one day the jack he come
    to Adam and said: 'Ide like you to make my tail hang down like the
    other fellerses tails, cause they say Ime proud.’</p>

  <p>“Adam knew that the jackus was really proud and he wondered, Adam did,
    why he wanted his tail down, but he done it and the jack thanked him
    and went away. Bime bi Adam he seen the jackuses trackx all thrugh the
    barly field, and it had et barly. Then he knew the jack had ask him to
    let down his tail so it wouldn’t show above the barly and be tray him.
    So Adam he said: 'You are a mighty smart feller for a thief. Ile keep
    my sacred word about that tail, but you will wish you hadent spoke.’</p>

  <p>“So the tail hangs down, to this day, but evry little while the jackus
    yields to a inate ambition and primevle desire for to set it up like
    it was made, but when ever he tries to arise it it hurts him so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> awfle
    that he utters his soul in mournful song.</p>

  <p>“Johnny, you just let the morral of this story sink deep into your
    heart and you will grow up a good man and some day be Presdent.”</p>

  <p>If I was Presdent I would take my big sword and cleave the wicked
    Demcrats in twain, for the Bible it says them which is sinners shall
    have ever lastin life!</p>

  <p>I said did Uncle Ned know what for Mexican dogs havent got any hair,
    and he said: “Yes, I learnt it from a old man script which I found in a
    Hindoo temple in Kansas. One day soon after the creation Adam he was a
    walkin in the Garden and he seen a dog with long curly hair which hung
    clear down to the ground. Adam he said: 'My! what a beautiful back of
    hair you have got.’</p>

  <p>“Now, the dog was a fool and prouded his self on his hair, so he
    answered: 'You ought to seen it fore I had that fever. It hasent been
    the same since.’</p>

  <p>“Adam he knew there hadnt been no fever, cause there wasnt any sin, for
    it is sin which makes a feller sick.”</p>

  <p>I ast Uncle Ned was it sin which made Franky sick the time he had a
    pain in his lap and howled like he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span> cats. Uncle Ned said: “Yes, it
    was, cause the sins of the father shall be fisted on to the childern,
    and you are mighty lucky it was Franky in stead of you which sufferd
    for my wicked brothers Repubcan afiliations. It will be you next time
    if you dont stop encurrigin him to support a Presdent which eats with
    niggers. But I was tellin you about that dog.</p>

  <p>“When Adam heard him lie he made a jump at him for to kick him over
    the garden wall, but the dog he lit out for Mexico so fast that the
    friction of the atmisphere set him afire and burnt his hair every
    little bit off. He lived for to found a large famly in the land of his
    adoption, but they are all bald just like he was.</p>

  <p>“Now, my boy, you go and tell your angel sister about this, cause there
    never was a woman which dident say her hair used to be longer fore
    she had a fever. They are mighty funny, women be, and have got to be
    crushed out with a ironicle hand!”</p>

  <p>Yesterday Mister Pitchel, thats the preacher, he was to our house, and
    he said to Uncle Ned: “Brother Edward, have you read in the paper a
    bout the cruelty of the warden at the Sing Sing penitentionary?” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he said he did, and it was just like him, for he is a
    Repubcan.</p>

  <p>Then my father spoke up and said: “Politics hasnt got any thing to do
    with it. Its cause the prisners is Demcrats.”</p>

  <p>Mister Pitchel he said: “Surely, Robert, you don’t justfy mistreatin
    convicks be cause of their politicle faiths!”</p>

  <p>My father said: “Yes, I do. When a fellers politicle faith makes him
    burgle, and garote, and bigam, and larcen, and shoot, and go to the
    theater with a other mans wife I say shut him up in a dark, unwholesome
    cell and give him fits three times a day with a black snake whip. If I
    was that warden and any news paper man come around pokin his nose in
    to none of his business Ide take him by the scruf of his pants and the
    seat of his neck and chuck him into the bay. I respeck the preachin
    trade much as any body, Mister Pitchel, but I bedam if I wouldent!”</p>

  <p>Then Uncle Ned he said: “Robert, your eminent services in reformin the
    geography of this state entitle you to a respectable hearin, even when
    you dont swear, and I should like to have your views on penology more
    at length.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

  <p>My father he said: “What is penology?” and Uncle Ned said it was the
    sience of punishment. Then my father he said: “My views on penology is
    to lickum.”</p>

  <p>Mister Pitchel he said: “Then you blieve in the eficacy of phisical
    torture?”</p>

  <p>My father he said: “I blieve it hurts, and that is all I want to know
    about it. But come to think, I guess it does a heap of good too. When
    Billy and Johnny gets it, and they dont have to ask me twice for it, it
    isnt necessary for me to waste any time after ward a pointin out the
    wickedness of dizzy bedience and expoundin the beauty of a godly life.
    They seem to get on to all that their own selfs, and to remain in a
    proper state of mind for quite a little wile. What is good enough for
    my boys is good enoughf for stealers, and cheaters, and assassinaters,
    and fellers which buy ice cream for other fellers wifes, like I said be
    fore. My further views on penology is that when a gum dasted galoot is
    sent to prison I dont care a ding what is the nature of his xperence
    there, nor whether at the end of his term he comes 4th alive or not.
    If he didnt like the way the house is conducted he neednt have gone
    into it. The warden isnt a standin outside the front door invitin any
    body in for to share the ospices of the place. The sons of guns invites
    their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> selfs!”</p>

  <p>When my father had got done he looked all round for some thing to kick,
    but Bildad, thats the new dog, he knew what was up and snook under the
    sofa, and Mose, which is the cat, he fled afar.</p>

  <p>But the Bible it says dont let your angry passions rise up and call you
    blest. And thats why I say man is of few days and full of woman.</p>

    <h3 id="SOLJERS">SOLJERS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">SOLJERS isent animals, but they can lick the hi potamus and the tagger,
    and the rhi nosey rose, and evry thing which is in the world. When
    I grow up Ime a going for to be a soljer, and then Ile draw my long
    sticker and cut off all the fellers which I dont likes heads and say:
    “Hooray! that will teach you that Columby is the gem of the ocean.”</p>

  <p>Then the Presdent will say: “What a brave soljer, make him a major
    General and give him all the candy which he can eat!”</p>

  <p>One time there was some cannon soljers a shootin off cannons at a
    target, and one of them was out in front, bout a hundred feet to one
    side of the target, for to see if it was hit, but it wasent, cause the
    cannon balls they kept a comin real close to his self and makin him
    duck and dance lively, you never seen such a frighten soljer!</p>

  <p>Just as he was a goin to run away, cause he couldnt stand it, bang went
    a cannon ball right through the bulls eye of the target. Then he took
    his pipe out of his pocket, and fild it, and while he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> a feelin for
    a match he said to his self: “Ime all right now, cause they have got
    mad and are a shootin at <i>me</i>.”</p>

  <p>One day while our front door was a standin open, my father, which had
    just come in, he met Mary, thats the house maid, in the hall, and he
    said: “Mary, I know what you like, there is some soljers comin down the
    street with a brass band, and—” but fore he could say a other word Mary
    just vannished like she was shot out of a gun and was a flyin down the
    street for to see the soljers, and my mother she stepped out of the
    parlor with Franky in her arms. My father he looked at her, and then he
    looked at Franky, and then he took off his spettacles and wiped them,
    real careful, and put them on again, and took a other look, and said:
    “Why, bless my soul, I would have swore it was Mary! You go in the
    kitchen and tell her to take off her apron, and put on her jacket and
    her hat, and slick her self up a bit, and go and see the soljers.”</p>

  <p>I ast Mister Gipple wasnt he proud when he was a soljer, and he
    said, Mister Gipple did: “I wasnt proud only but one time. One day
    a ungenerus fo took a mean advantige of me and come at me with his
    sticker when my hands was full. I turnd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> my back on him, real scornful,
    for about a mile, then he fleed and I entered my camp in triump!”</p>

  <p>I said what was Mister Gippleses hands full of, and he said: “Johnny,
    if you had ast me at the time, I couldnt have told you, but when my
    captain pinted it out to me I remembered. They was full of revolvers.”</p>

  <p>But if me and Billy was there Billy would met that cowerd fo, eye to
    eye, and laughfed him to scorn! When he is a man he is a goin for to
    be a captin of milishes, and ride a majesticle black steed, and cut
    Demcrats heads off and fling them to the Presdents feets, a shoutin the
    battle cry of fredom! But give me a home on the ocean wave, with a nice
    Sunday school book and plenty pirates for my pray!</p>

  <p>Jack Brily, which is the wicked sailor, swears and chews tobaco and
    every thing, he says once when he was a pirate there was a other ship
    which looked like it was about to flounder. Jacks captin he said: “That
    ship is dangerously over manned. Jack, you take all our men and board
    her and make all hern walk the plank.”</p>

  <p>So Jack and all the other pirates xcept the captin they give 3 cheers
    and got in their boat, with their cutlashes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> drawed, and boarded the
    ship, insted of which about a thousand jolly, jolly mariners arosed up
    from the deck and pointed blunder busters at them, and the captain of
    the ship come forwerd and said: “In reply to this funny way of hailin a
    strange craft I have to say that this is the <i>Nancy Ann</i>, 7 days
    out from Boston, and over loaded with apple pies. We was just a goin
    for to jettison some of the cargo, but I guess you fellers will do just
    as well.”</p>

  <p>So Jack and his mates was made to sit down and eat apple pies till they
    was most busted and dead sick. That made the ship so light that she
    walked the waters like a thing alive, and the pirate captin was left
    lamentin.</p>

  <p>I ast Jack why that didnt make a honest man of him, and he said: “It
    did, Johnny, it did. I resolvd for to repent and lead a bitter life,
    and I havnt been a apple pirate from that memorable day. Mince and
    helpin in my dads butcher shop is good enoughf for me.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he says he guesses that is true, for Jack is mighty well
    qualified for to swear off and on.</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple said did I know about the battle of Gettyburg. I said no,
    I didn’t, and he said: “Well, Johnny,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> Ile tell you, for it was the
    dandiest battle which ever was. I was there my self or it maybe would
    have been diferent.</p>

  <p>“You see, Johnny, our soljers was on a hill, and Mister Lees was on a
    other, but ourn was the best hill and they wanted it. But Mister Mead,
    which was our captin, he was a brave man, and he sent for me to come
    over behind our hill, where he was readin a novel, and he said, Mister
    Mead did: 'General Gipple, if them misguided fellers which are in arms
    again our country and the Repubcan party come over our way and want to
    get on this side the fence you shut the gate in their gum dasted faces
    and tell them to clear out.’</p>

  <p>“So I went back, and pretty soon I seen Mister Picket a comin, follerd
    by ten thousand hunderd rebbel soljers, and I shut the gate. When they
    had come real close up Mister Picket poked his ugly head over the fence
    and said: 'Hello, Yank, we want to get in for to bile some coffy. The
    feller which we are on his farm he wont let us light fires.’</p>

  <p>“Then I spoke up in thunder tones and said, real sarcostic: 'You havnt
    got the price of admition.’ </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

  <p>“Mister Picket he said: 'Dont you dare to taunt us with our povity! Its
    true we aint rich, cause you have stole all that we had, but we are
    mighty many, for the angels is on our side.’</p>

  <p>“Then I spoke up real sneery, and said: 'If you have any regments of
    angels I guess they are sort of hangin back. I dont seem to see any of
    their wings a floppin in the breeze.’</p>

  <p>“Just then Mister Hancock rode up behind me and said: 'Generl Gipple,
    stand firm, we got some angels of our own. Mister Mead ordered me to
    report to you with my whole dam celestial out fit.’</p>

  <p>“I said: 'Thank you, Mister Hancock, they will be right handy for to
    carry to Heaven the souls of the Confedit slane just as fast as I can
    supply them.’</p>

  <p>“And then, Johnny, I roled my sleefs up and that memorble slotter was
    began! I dont need to give you the bleedy details. Suffice it that
    when I was done that host lay withered and strew and Mister Picket was
    a hikin back to his base as fast as his 2 laigs could carry him, and
    our soljers was a singing the dogs ology real tuneful, like they was
    canarys.”</p>

  <p>I asked Mister Gipple did he do it all his own self, and he said:
    “Nuthin but only just the killin, Johnny. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>Far be it from me for to
    deprife my comrads of the glory which justly blongs to the sons of hope
    and faith. If it hadent been for the morl sport which they give me by
    cheerin me on, and by their xclamations of wonder and delight, it would
    have took me longer.”</p>

  <p>The Bible it says that thou shall not kill unless you are smote on one
    cheek or the other, but Uncle Ned he says a feller which would smite
    Mister Gipple on either cheek would skin his nuckles.</p>

  <p>A other time Mr. Gipple said: “Johnny, there is a other great warior
    in this town, and it is Mister Pitchel, which is the preacher, as you
    truly describe him. He was the chaplin of the army wen it was in Cuby.
    One day there was a real hard fight, and when he run away he got lost
    in the forest primevle. Then he see a feller down on his knees behind
    a tree, a prayin loud and shril. So Mister Pitchel he joind him and
    prayed too, but pretty soon he noticed that the feller was a prayin in
    Spanish, so Mister Pitchel he said amen mighty quick and got up for to
    resume his go. Then the Spainard he said amen too, and picked up a gun
    and hollered: 'Come back, ye dom herry tick, or if I dont make buzzerds
    meat of yer dhirty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> caircase may I nivver see ould Tiperary again!’</p>

  <p>“Mister Pitchel he went back and was took prisner. Then he said: 'I
    guess you was a prayin for the sucksess of the Spainish arms, wasent
    you?’</p>

  <p>“The feller said: 'The divel a bit, they have been licked and I was
    prayin for the sucksess of their legs, as is the duty of me holy
    office. Ime their chaplin, bedad.’”</p>

  <p>Mister Pitchel says he will pray for Mister Gippleses sinful soul, but
    Mister Gip he says: “Jest let me catch him at it, thats all!”</p>

  <p>A captin of soljers he went to the camp of the enemies and said: “Some
    of you fellers has been a sassin some of us, what for did they do that?”</p>

  <p>The captin of the enemies he said: “O go long about your business, we
    havent got any thing agin you.”</p>

  <p>The other captin he said: “Then why do you come in to this neck o woods
    and sass us?”</p>

  <p>The captin of the sassers said: “Why dont you move in to a other county
    fore we are drove by a relentless fate for to lick you like blazes?” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

  <p>The captin which had come over he said: “A destiny which is deaf to our
    prayers compels us to remain and wollup the innerds out of you.”</p>

  <p>And Mister Gip says that when the relentless fate stacked up aginst the
    destiny which was deaf to prayer the earth was piled with hetty combs
    of slain!</p>

  <p>But if any body would sass Billy he would cleeve him to the chine!</p>

  <p>My father was a readin a news paper, and all to once he give a long
    wissle and said he would be gum dasted! Uncle Ned he looked up and said
    what was it, and my father he said by cracky, that was the awfulest
    which he ever in his life!</p>

  <p>My mother she jumpt up, and so did me and Billy, and Missy, and Bildad,
    the new dog, and Mose, which is the cat. My father he was so xcited
    that his spettacles fell off and he couldnt read no more till they was
    found, and all the wile he kept a sayin we was in for it, shure, and it
    was just what he had been xpectin, and he had always told us it would
    come. Bime bi my mother put his spettacles on his nose again, and he
    found the place and read, “The war broke out again. The Solid South in
    battle aray! The nations capitle in flames! Dredful massaker of the
    colored peoples in Virginy!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span> Thousands of United States troops shot
    dead in their trackx!”</p>

  <p>Then he seen it was nothing only but just a advertisement of a patent
    tooth brush and cloes pin combined, and he stopt and got red in the
    face, and wiped his spettacles with his thum, and put the paper in the
    fire, and said: “Edard, you better stay to home and look after the
    women and children, and mebby keep my memry green if I fall. Ime a goin
    for to march against the fo!”</p>

  <p>Then he went out and stayed a week. And thats why I say be it ever so
    humble, theres no place like home.</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned, which has been in Indy and every where, he says one time in
    Siam the king said to his captin of soljers: “I been supportin you and
    your lazy fellers for 20 years, and you havnt done nothing for your
    keep, only just eat and drink your heads off.”</p>

  <p>The captin he said, the captin did: “Why, we have a inspecktion every
    little while, and 2 drills a month, and a dress parade evry day, with a

  <p>The king said: “Yes, I know, but you dont do no fightin.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

  <p>The captin he said: “The drummer he knockt the bugler silly only jest
    yesterdy, the 1st sargent has a black eye most of the time when he isnt
    drunk, and I punches the corples head my self, quite frequent.”</p>

  <p>But the king he said: “That aint enoughf, you got to go and thrash the
    fellers army which is a kingin on the other side of the boundry. If you
    suckceed in piercin his lines I will make you a earl.”</p>

  <p>So they marched away with banners a flopin, and a long time after werd
    the king got a letter from the captin of soljers, and the letter said:</p>

  <p>“Dear Madgesty,</p>

  <p>After a good deal of skilful manoover I have pierced the enemys lines
    without a man killed, but the number of missin is considerable. In
    fact, my whole army is missin. I guess it is about where it was when I
    begun for to move on the enemys works single handed, but I dont know.
    You neednt make me a earl, for the king over here has made me a duke.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">MY sisters young man he said: “Johnny, di ever tell you about Jony and
    the wale?”</p>

  <p>But I said: “You cant fool me, you want me to say yes, and then you
    will say taint so, cause the Bible dont say it was a wale, but a big
    fish, and a wale isnt a fish.”</p>

  <p>Then he said: “No, Johnny, it was a wale, I give you my honor, cross my
    heart and hope to die, and what I wanted for to pint out is the Bible
    says Jony was threw up by the wale after bein swollered, but it stands
    to reason it wasn’t so. No, Johnny, he must have digested and become a
    part of the wale, for when he was shut up in the stumach of its belly
    the thought of home and friends would naturly make him blubber.”</p>

  <p>Then my sister she said: “Any one which falsifys the Scripter and puts
    his word against a Bible truth to make such a silly joke as that will
    go where the worm dieth not, so there!”</p>

  <p>But her young man he said: “Ile take along a early bird and have some
    fun with that feller.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

  <p>Jack Brily he was a tellin old Gaffer Peters one day how he was to a
    mining town, and how he fished down a shaft, with a line 20 hundred
    feet long. Gaffer he said: “What a whopper, I been to mines my own
    self, and I know the water in a mine is blazin hot.”</p>

  <p>Jack said: “Thats what makes it easy for to catch the fish, you only
    got to use ice cream for bait. Them poor fish is crazy for ice cream.”</p>

  <p>Then old Gaffer said: “Why, Jack Brily, do you think Ime a iddiot jest
    cause my hair aint curly like yourn? If there was fish in that water
    they would be boild.”</p>

  <p>Jack said: “Thats just it, Gaffer, thats just the idee, cause I dont
    consider fried fish is fit to eat.”</p>

  <p>But give me plenty potatos, and mints pies, and peserves, and some do
    nots, and molasses, and apple dumps, and Ile take them fried and boild
    too.</p>

  <p>A other time Jack was a tellin old Gaffer how he was a travelin once
    when he had been ship wreck and didn’t have nothin for to eat, and bime
    bi he come to a big lake of oil. So he upped and baited his fish hook
    and threw in his line, and in a little while he had cetched a wagon
    load of shads.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

  <p>Gaffer he said: “How could shads live in oil?”</p>

  <p>Jack he thought a wile, and pretty soon he said: “Thats a fact, Gaffer
    you have raked me fore and aft. Them fish was sardeens.”</p>

  <p>And old Gaffer hasnt never got done braggin about how he caught Jack in
    a lie and made him own up.</p>

  <p>One time a nigger fell off a ship and the sailors threw him a rope,
    which he caught, and they was a haulin him up when a shark snapped him
    in 2. Just then a Southern planter, which was a pasenger, he come on
    deck and looked over the side of the ship and seen the shark do it. He
    was xcited and hollered: “It has took your hook boys, it has took your
    hook! Bring a other one and get a fresh nigger!”</p>

  <p>Some folks thinks niggers is just as good as white men, cause God made
    us all in 6 days and was arrested on the 7th.</p>

    <h3 id="THE_POL_PATRIOT">THE POL PATRIOT</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">UNCLE NED he said: “Johnny, do you know about the pol patriot?”</p>

  <p>I said: “Yessir, it can be tought for to talk, just like gerls, and
    says, 'Polly wants a cracker,’ frequent.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he thought a wile, and bime bi he said: “This appears to be a
    case of mistaken eye dentistry, though there really is a resemble tween
    the pol parrot and the pol patriot, particlar in their cast of mind and
    their deplorable habit of saying what you have got tired of hearin. But
    the patriot he frequent makes the welkin ring, where as the other sport
    she only just shreeks like laughfter in a toomb. Both is 2 leggers, but
    the patriots is hind ones, and wen he wants to think he mounts them
    like a step ladder and does the trick with his toung, mighty awdible.”</p>

  <p>I ast did the patriot have wings, and Uncle Ned said: “Wings is used
    for to go some where, but the patriot isnt migratary. He never gets
    very far away from his mouth, cause that is his place of business. No,
    my boy, the patriot never deserts his country, for he loves it and it
    is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> easy for to digest. He admires its instutions like they was pretty
    girls in white muslin gowns, servin pie. Its pocket is the haven of
    his hand, and the fat on his kidneys is public property dedicated to
    private use.”</p>

  <p>But what he meant by all that rigmy roll is what floors me, and Billy
    is the same way. And thats why the Bible it says that wisdom is the
    root of all evil and flys from the rwath to come.</p>

  <p>My sisters young man he said: “Johnny, if you was a sniposquatamus what
    would you rather be?”</p>

  <p>I said it would be nice for to be a pirate, and he said: “Yes, I spose
    it would if it wasnt for the hangin, but I was thinkin mebby you would
    like to be a brother in law, which are usually acquited.”</p>

  <p>Then Missy she spoke up and said he ought to be a shamed of his self,
    puttin wicked thoughts in to a inocent childs head, and tryin to break
    up a happy home, you never seen sech a dresin down as that feller got!</p>

  <p>When it was all over he looked at her real sorroful and said: “Yes, I
    see I have went to far, dear, so if you dont mind I will just step in
    to the kitchen and take a carvin knife and cut my heart out. Johnny,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
    you come with me for to hear my last words and wipe up the gore.”</p>

  <p>But when I begun for to cry he said: “Never mind, Ime a awful firm
    chap, but not stuborn, and rather than pain your young soul Ile
    postpone the rash deed and content my self with slayin your Uncle Ned.”</p>

  <p>Then Missy said he was a riddiclous old thing and wouldnt hurt a fly.</p>

  <p>Flys are insecks, and a wops is a be, but butter flys is a catter
    piller at first, and then it is a crisanthemum.</p>

  <p>And now I will tell you a story about Mister Gipple when he was a
    mitionary preacher in Madgigasker and had amast a considable frotchune
    in ephalents tushes. Mister Gip is always bragin about the kings he has
    met, and he says one day he met the king of Madgigasker, which said:
    “Ime told that you are a preachin aginst the gods of my fathers and
    have busted the heads off of some of them. Is that so?”</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple he said: “Yes, brother, it has been a joy to me to spread
    the light quite wide, and Ime thankfle to say that a few of the ugly
    idles which you fellers bow down to have suckummd to the power of the
    everlasty truth as it is give me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> to see it.”</p>

  <p>The king said: “Ime a little tired of them idles my self, dont you
    think it would help along the good mitionary work for you to convert
    Me?”</p>

  <p>Mister Gip he was just happy half to death, and he said: “Yes, indeed,
    and if you have time we will begin right now. First you must stop
    cuttin your wives noses off for every little thing which they do.”</p>

  <p>The king he said, the king did: “I stopt that this morning. They are
    all off.”</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple he wiped away a tear and said: “You must bless them which
    hate you.”</p>

  <p>Then the king he said: “The darn galoots darent come near enough to me
    for to hear the blessing.”</p>

  <p>So Mister Gip he said: “Well, we will pass that for the present. When
    your dog dies you must not discumbowel your high priest on its grave.”</p>

  <p>The king said: “All right, my priminister will do just as well.”</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple he was mighty discuraged, but he said: “You mustnt have
    any of your nevews and nieces buried alive when you are took sick.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

  <p>The king said: “No fear of that, I have been in mighty poor health all
    summer.”</p>

  <p>That shocked Mister Gip so much that he hardly knew what he was a
    sayin, and he showted: “Poor miserable worm of the dust!”</p>

  <p>Then the king, which had been sittin on his hawnches, he rose his
    self up, mighty magesticle, and said: “I have made every resonable
    consession and tried to meet you half way, but when you call me names
    you are a goin too far. You jest put new heads on them idles, and give
    up all the wealth of ephalents teeths in which you waller, and take
    your gum dasted new fangle religion out of my kingdom, or I will skin
    your legs!”</p>

  <p>But if any old nigger king would skin mine I would hurl him from
    the throne, for the Bible says that all men are created equal, and
    endowered with unavailable rights. And thats why the people are the
    sores of power.</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he said: “Johnny, one time in Indy I knew a natif nigger
    named Jejybehoy Bilk. He lived just out side the village of
    Ipecack-in-the-Jingle and had a mighty nice wife. She didnt wear much
    cloes, cause they was poor, but one day I see her a wearin a taggers
    skin, and I ast Jej what for she drest so warm in the summer. Jej he
    said: ‘Cause a tagger has arived in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> parts and is makin quite
    free with the peoples. Me and Mary Ann thinks that if she wears a
    taggers skin when she has to go out to gether sticks mebby the tag will
    think her a other tag, and spare her life.’</p>

  <p>“I told him I thought it a good idee, and pretty soon after, when I
    met him again, I said: 'Good mornin, how is Mary Ann, and is she still
    wearin a taggers skin?’</p>

  <p>“Jej he looked sollemn and said: 'Yes, Edard Sahib, a taggers skin and
    a taggers ribs too, in fact, she is wearin a whole tagger.’</p>

  <p>“Johnny, she had been et.” </p>

    <h3 id="COWS">COWS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THERE was a feller which had a cow, and the cow had some burs in the
    tossel of her tail, and the feller he tried for to pick them out. He
    put his fingers through the tossel, like they was a comb, and jest then
    the cow she got afraid and started for to walk away. The feller he
    couldnt hold her, and he couldnt get his fingers out, so he had to go
    too. He said “wo,” and “steddy, now,” and “no occasion for to hurry,”
    and evry thing which he culd think of, but the cow she just kept right
    on, a goin round and round the field, and him a follerin.</p>

  <p>Pratty soon a big savvage bul dog it come, and after it had showed its
    teeths and looked on a while it fell in behind the feller and follered
    too. So they kept a goin, the old cow and the feller and the bull dog,
    the dog a smellin the mans legs and makin up its mind where to take
    hold. The feller he didn’t know whether he would rather have the dog
    bite him or bite the cow, but he kept a sayin “wo, bossy,” and “good
    doggy,” mighty polite.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

  <p>Bime by a other man he see them and he brought a bucket of slop and
    set it down, and when they got round to it the cow she stopt for to
    have some, and when her tail was slack the fellers fingers come loose
    all right. Then he turned round to the dog, which was settin down a
    grinnin, an he shooked his fist at the dog, the feller did, and said:
    “You worthless brute, you must take them by the tail, like I have told
    you 100 thousand times! If its a goin to take a half a year for me to
    teach you how to drive a gentle cow like this Ile sell you, for what
    ever I can get.”</p>

  <p>But it was the man that brought the slops dog.</p>

  <p>Some cows is hooky, but the mooly she buts, and thats why I say beware
    the awfle avilantch!</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he says why dont I write about Mister Jonnice, which has the
    wood leg. I ast him why Mister Jonnice wasent made Presdent for loosin
    his leg so many times for his country, and he said: “He isnt eligible,
    for he wasnt borned of American parents. His father was Conshience and
    his mother was Truth, and when he was a little feller like you he lived
    with her at the bottom of a well. So he dident come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span> to this country
    till one day he was axidental drew up in a old oaken bucket. Johnny
    that man inherits from his mother. He is so truthfle that when he says
    a thing is so, why, it wouldnt be any more so if he rwote it down in
    red ink and swore to fore a bald headed notary. He is so truthfle that
    he faces east when he wants to tell a lie north west. Do you remember
    that story of his about the bear? He was one day goin through the woods
    when a big black bear arose itself up before him and began for to
    hug him real cruel. Mister Jonnice he said: 'Why, darling, this is a
    unexpected hapiness. When did you get in?’</p>

  <p>“Then he threw his 2 arms around the bear and squeezed it so tight that
    when he let go it lay down and turned so white with sick that Mister
    Jonnice toted it to a circus and sold it for a polar.</p>

  <p>“A other time Mister Jonnice was attacted by a lion which came a rushin
    at him with its mouth wide open and all its teeths on parade. Mister
    Jonnice he just stood still and lifted his wood leg up and stuck it
    strait out toward the lion, and the lion went on every side of it like
    a bottle around a cork. So the immoral spirit of that monark of the
    desert winged its way to a other and bitter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> world fourth with. Mister
    Jonnice says that was the first step in his honable career as a lion
    tamer. I guess the second is still to be took.</p>

  <p>“Such, my boy, is Mister Jonnice, but the jasky foozle is a other
    animal. It inhabbits the crags of the Gangee river and its fluty warble
    is heard along with the song of the whipperwil when the natf niggers
    pay poker in the gloaming. Its one tooth is white as the soul of a
    unborn babe and the shine of its eye is like moon beams on the water
    of deep Galalee. When it arises its golden locks above the horizon a
    lovely shadow is flung athwort the land and the chickens go to roost
    a singing their sweetest songs. It is a six legger, and each leg has
    a brass hoof, so the sound of its feetsteps is like chimes of church
    bells on a Sabath morning in Normandy. But beware, Johnny, beware the
    jasky foozle when summer is green, for it is crueler than the butcher
    buisnes and pizen as the grave! When it points its nose your way your
    mother wants to see you mighty bad and your legs should be ship shape
    for to perform their office.</p>

  <p>“Much more might be said, but I see old Gaffer Peters a comin over to
    have a smoke with me, and I guess I better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span> go out behind the barn and
    plant some coco nuts.”</p>

  <p>I guess if there was a fight tween the jasky foozle and the rhi nupple
    dinky and some others of them fellers which Uncle Ned and Jack Brily
    and Mister Gipple tells about it would be mighty hard for to say which
    was which, and a picture of one would do for them all.</p>

  <p>One day Mister Pitchel, thats the preacher, he seen a picture which
    shocked him, cause it repsented a drunk man, but my father he said:
    “Well, dont men get drunk, what you growlin about?”</p>

  <p>Mister Pitchel he said did my father aproove every thing in art which
    is true to nature, and my father he said: “Mister Pitchel, you have
    knew me all my life for a onest man which pays his debts and votes the
    straight Repubcan ticket, like he is told, and loves his neibor as
    his dog, and wears a stopipe hat quite frequent. Yet you ask me sech
    a question as that! As I under stand it, the feller which is always
    objectin to naturlness in art is always a sweepin the horizen with a
    spy glass and a bendin his self doubble over a microscape for to find
    some thing to objeck to. He wants to snuffle or to blush, cause if he
    dont he will <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>be sick.”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned, which is a batchelor, he said he guessed folks like that was
    mostly women.</p>

  <p>Then my father he said: “I havnt got a word to say about any but the
    he ones, for Johnny has pointed out in his writins that woman is the
    noblest animal which roams the plain and roars like distant thunder.
    But, Edard, the he ones is decendents of them old Puritans which come
    to this country when it was little, because in their own they wasnt
    let sing hyms through their noses. They landed on Plymuth Rock when it
    was jest as easy to step a shore on the grass, and they expect us to
    cellebrate it. They liked rocks, particklar to fire at other folkes.
    They used to lick the Injens, too, cause the Injens looked sort of
    naturel, and came to prayer meeting in their breech clouts, jest as
    they was created.</p>

  <p>“Edard, them Puritan 4 fathers of ourn were a gam doodled bad outfit.
    When ever one of them had loaded up his old bell mouth blunder bust
    with led enoughf for to sink a shot goose, and had got it rightly
    pointed at a Injen which mebby wanted his land back, he shet his eyes
    up a minute, the Pu did, and, said: 'O Lord of Love, I am about to
    discharge a sacred duty, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>if any fo to religion gets his self in
    the way let my light so shine that it will shine right through his
    benighted innards, and thine shall be the glory, but Ile take his
    blanket and his beads my self. Yours truly, Worm-o-the-Dust Muggins.’”</p>

  <p>One day I was a readin a wondful story about a cammel and a Arrab, and
    my father he spoke up and said I mustnt blieve only but half of what I
    read. Jest then the story ended by sayin that the half wasent told, and
    my father he said: “Thats the half to blieve.”</p>

  <p>A Arrab chief was a leadin his cammel by the halter and a thinkin real
    hard, but the cam hadnt any thing in particklar for to ocupy its mind,
    so after a wile it snook up and lifted the chiefs turban in its teeths
    and et it. Bime bi the chief he begun for to feel the sun a bakin his
    head like it was a potato in the uven, cause they shave their hair evry
    little bit off, and he stopt and looked around at the cam. The cam
    started like it was shot, and puld the holter out of the Arrabs hand,
    and stared at him and walked away and stared again, much as to say: “I
    never have seen you before in all my life, dont you come near me.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

  <p>But after a long time it let it self be cought, and when the Arrab had
    turned his back for to resume the voyge the cam drawed the 2 ends of
    its mouth up to its ears and wank its eye repeated.</p>

  <p>Mister Gipple he says a other Arrab, which was a travisin the dessert,
    lay down for to sleep, and in the middle of the night he woke, and set
    up, and rubbed his eyes, and looked again, and final said: “Allah be
    praised for grantin His servant this vizion of the Holy Mountain!”</p>

  <p>Then he lay down in the sand with his face toward the Holy Mountain,
    which he could see real plain on the horizen against the stars. He
    knocked his fored against the ground and prayd all night, but in the
    mornin he see it was only just his cammel a kneelin between him and the
    ski. So he took a stick, the Arrab did, and beat the cam, and said it
    wasnt fit for to carry a True Bliever.</p>

  <p>But the Bible it says that cammels can go through the knee of a idol.</p>

  <p>I ast Uncle Ned what makes the cam have a hunch on his back, and he
    said, Uncle Ned did: “One day, in the Garden of Edin the animals was a
    showin off what they culd do, and the kangaroon he said <span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>he could jump
    high upper than any other thing which was made in the immage of its
    Maker. The cammel curled his lip up, real scornfle and said: 'Why, you
    gum dasted creepin thing, I dont blieve you can leave the ground by 10
    inches. Jest try for to jump over <i>me</i> and you will find out what
    a many rooted vegtable you are.’</p>

  <p>“So the cam, which was made long like a dox hoond and had a straight
    back, it stood still, and the kang he took a few hops and then soared
    aloft to go over the cam. But the cam he wank his eye to the other
    fellers, much as to say, 'See me fix him!’ and then he huncht his back
    up real sudden, and tript the kang, which turned a flip flop and lit on
    his head an pretty near broke the spine of his back.</p>

  <p>“When Adam was told about it he said to the cammel: 'Let me see how you
    done it.’</p>

  <p>“The cam he huncht his self up again, the same way, and Ad he lifted
    up his hands and made some passes in the air and said: 'Presto,
    abricadabbry, whee! You jest stay that way while the stars hold their
    courses in the fermament and the seasons on earth is bad for the
    crops.’ </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

  <p>“So the cammel is hunchy to this day, and his countnence is deep graven
    with lines of care and sorry.”</p>

  <p>But if Adam had saw Billy lick Sammy Doppy for his doin that to me when
    we played leap frog he would have said, Adam would: “What simpleness!
    Why didnt I think to do that to the cam?” </p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">FLIES is 3 kinds, butter, and fire, and jest flies. The butter he is
    first a tadpole, and then he is a crisanthmum, and bime bi he is a real
    butter, but not a goat. Mister Pitchel, thats the preacher, he says
    that the butter fly a bustin out of the crisanthmum state in to a new
    life prooves that we have imortle souls, but my father he says what is
    prooved by the butty dyin pretty soon after?</p>

  <p>Once me and Uncle Ned and Missy, thats my sister, we was in the garden
    and there was a butter fly, and Missy she said why was they like girls,
    meanin that they are fond of flowers, or is pretty, or some sech rot.</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he spoke up and said: “Cause its good fun to chase them, but
    it spiles them to catch them.”</p>

  <p>He says 2 men which had been in a election riot was goin to their homes
    in the country one night, and one said to the other: “Let me lean on
    you, and what ever happens dont you desert a old friend.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

  <p>When they had gone a mile or 2 that way the other feler he said: “Dont
    you feel any better now?”</p>

  <p>The staggery man he said: “No, not much, Ime a fraid I will drop. It
    must been a awfle blow, not any pain for to speak of, but Ime a seein
    stars till this minute!”</p>

  <p>Then the other feller he seen how it was, cause it was only jest the
    fire flies, which was evry where, and he said to his self: “A wise man
    cant make no body wise, but a fool can make a fool of a other man.”</p>

  <p>When it is a hot day my father he lies down for to sleep. He snores a
    while, and then he wakes up and says: “Cuss them flies! Johnny, bring
    me the <i>Tribune</i>,” and puts it over his face like it was a tent
    and his nose was the center pole. One day I give him the <i>Times</i>,
    which Mister Brily, thats the fat butcher, had sent around a calfs
    toung, and when my father he waked and seen what paper it was he said:
    “Johnny, dident you know what paper this thing is?”</p>

  <p>I said I did, and he said: “Dont you know that flies is better than the
    <i>Times</i>?”</p>

  <p>Then I said: “Yes, father, but there was a wops.”</p>

  <p>Father he thought a long time, and final he said: “Well, my son, you
    know what I think of flies, and you know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> I think of news papers,
    and particklar you know what I think of the New York <i>Times</i>, but,
    Johnny, if there was a wops, and you heard it say that it was a goin to
    sit on your fathers nose and sting him deep in both his beutiful eyes,
    and your sister was a wearin the <i>Tribune</i> for to improve her
    figgure, I will over look your fault this time if you get out of this
    real quick.”</p>

  <p>So I jumpt out of the door jest as he flang a book at me.</p>

  <p>The Bible it says thou shall be kind to thy father, for of such is the
    kingdom of Heaven, but the wicked shall have eternle life.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">A MAN had a pet munky, and the mans boy hated the munky cause it done
    every thing which he done his self. One terrible cold winter evenin the
    boy got 2 buckets of water and set them out doors. Then he got a piece
    of rope and tied it around him under his jacket and let the end hang
    down like it was a tail, and then he set down on the edge of one bucket
    and let the rope hang in the water. The munky it looked on, and then
    it tost its head, contemptible, much as to say it could do that too,
    and it went to the other bucket and done it. Then the water it froze
    and the boy he untied the rope and went in the house, but the munky
    couldent untie its tail, and it stayd there and in the mornin it was
    froze to death.</p>

  <p>When the man found the dead munk he swore awful, cause he liked him,
    but the boy he come up and put his kanuckle in his eye, like he was
    cryin, and said: “Poor little feller, what a pity he died jest as he
    had got most out.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

  <p>Mister Gipple he says there was a painter, and he painted a picture of
    a awfle hiddeous babboon, and he was mighty homely his own self. His
    wife she hadnt see the picture, cause she was pretty and didnt care for
    art. One day the painter he looked in the parlor where his wife was,
    and said: “Ime a goin out, and shant be back till a long time,” for he
    was takin the picture of the bab to the mans house which had bought
    it. But when he got there the man was too sick abed for to look at it,
    so he brought it back home, the painter did, and as he was a passin
    the parlor window he looked in and seen his wife a sleep in her chair,
    facin the window.</p>

  <p>Then the painter he said to hisself: “I will give her a good scare.” So
    he set the picture on the window sil out side, like it was a lookin in,
    and then he let his self in the house with a lach key, and set down by
    his wife, and took her hand and prest it mighty lovin, and she smiled
    in her sleep and mummered “Dear Henry,” which wasnt his name. After a
    while she opend her eyes and seen the picture of the bab a lookin in
    to the window. She started like she was shot dead, and with out lookin
    round she cried out: “O my! he has come back. Get under the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>piano!”</p>

  <p>Now what is the sense of sech a story as that? But the rhi nosey rose
    is the king of beasts.</p>

  <p>Jack Brily, which is the wicked sailor, he says one time him and the
    captin of his ship and the bosen they went a shore on a savvage iland
    for to look for coco nuts. While Jack was a little way from the captin
    and the bosen the natif niggers they come and catched them fellers
    and took them away and sinked the boat. Then they come back and run
    towards Jack for to catch him too, but Jack he stood on his head and
    made frightfle faces. So they said he was a god, and led him to their
    king, which showed him great respeck and took his cloes off and had him
    painted green and yellow, and set him on a clay throne and worshipt him
    while he continude to make mouths frequent.</p>

  <p>That night the natif niggers made a great feast of stew and Jack, which
    set by the king said: “What is it made of?”</p>

  <p>The king said: “It is horse, which is the noblest of birds.”</p>

  <p>So Jack, which was mighty hungry, he took a big wood spoon and fished
    round in the stew pot, and pretty soon brought up a lether belt, and a
    shoe string,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> and a finger ring. Then he suddenly leeped to his feets
    like a thing of life, and turned a hand spring, and roled his eyes
    awful, and shouted: “Rash mortle! Horse is forbid to be et by gods, and
    you have stewed it with the harness on! Fetch me some roasted munky
    this minute, with the tail on, or I will make your nose grow to your
    hand!”</p>

  <p>Jack says he stayed on the iland 5 years and was fed so much munky that
    when he excaped to a ship he scampered up the riggin and leeped from
    mast to mast and chattered srill! </p>

    <h3 id="BEARS">BEARS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">BEARS spend the winter in hollow logs and dont eat any thing till
    they come out in the spring. One fine spring day a bear come out of a
    farmers barn yard and the farmer he see him. Then the farmer said to
    his boy: “Jim, you go and tackle that feller and we will have his hide.
    He will be easy prey, for he is so thin that he cant cast a shadow.”</p>

  <p>The boy said: “Of course Ile do it if you say so, but he is castin a
    mighty black shaddow all the same.”</p>

  <p>The farmer he said: “Non sense, that is the shadow of one of our calfs.
    He has et it.”</p>

  <p>One time me and Billy was to the Zoo, and Billy went to the bears den.
    The bear sat up and made a lap and Billy he lit a fire cracker and
    threw it in the bears lap. The bear looked down at the cracker, which
    was a smokin in his fur, and then cocked his head, real knowin, much as
    to say: “You cant fool me, that aint no pea nut.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

  <p>But when the cracker went off you never have saw such a crazy bear!</p>

  <p>Fire crackers is fine, but give me the canons roar, and the chargers
    nay, and the flags a floppin in the breez, and heaps of slain!</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned says once in Indy when him and his dog was a strolin on the
    bank of the Gangee a bear come out of the jingle and started for to
    swim across. When the dog seen some thing in the water he jumpt in for
    to fetch it out, with out thinkin particlar what it might be, but it
    was the bears head. But when the dog had pretty near catched up with it
    it turned round and give him a smile, like sayin: “Its awfle good of
    you to take sech a friendly intrest in a stranger. When we get to the
    other side Ile ask you to dinner, and we will have dog.”</p>

  <p>But when the dog seen how things was he rememberd a previous
    engagement, and Uncle Ned says there wasnt never any body which tried
    so hard for to be punctual.</p>

  <p>Yestday was Valentines day and some wicked feller he sent me one which
    was the ugliest ever see. It is drew with a pen, and its me a settin on
    a Noays ark with wooden animals before me, and me a writin about them
    with my toung out and my legs twisted to gather like grape vines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> but
    not a bit like me, more like Billy. There is a big jackus a standin
    behine me with his mouth to my ear, like he was a whisperin in school,
    and this is the poetry which is under the pictur, bad spellin and all,
    I never see such fool poetry!</p>

  <p>When I got that I took it strait to Uncle Ned, and when he had read it
    he looked mighty mad. Then I said: “Uncle Ned, what becomes of wicked
    fellers souls when they die?”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he said: “Johnny, that is a question which will keep till
    you have a optunity to see for your self. This gum dasted villin says
    no mystry can flore you, but I guess its just as well not to go out of
    your way for to tackle mystries which are peaceful disposed. I respeck

  <p class="drop-cap">UNCLE NED he said yesterday did I know what was up. I said the girafts
    head was upper than any thing. Then he said, Uncle Ned did: “Thats so,
    Johnny, but what I mean is do you know what is a goin for to happen in
    this house, right under your 2 eyes?”</p>

  <p>Then I looked at my sister to see if she knew, but she was red in the
    face, like she was a lobster, and I said why didnt she set further away
    from the fire, but mother she said: “Never mind your sister, Johnny,
    your uncle is talkin to you, why dont you anser?”</p>

  <p>So I told him no, I didn’t know what was goin for to happen, less Billy
    was a goin to get a lickin, and he said: “That’s a safe guess, but what
    I mean is you are to have a new brother.”</p>

  <p>I said: “Hooray, I vote we name him Tommy!”</p>

  <p>Uncle Ned he beganned for to laugh, and mother she said: “Edard, if you
    have got any thing to say to Johnny why dont you say it like you was a
    man of sense,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> Johnny, you hush this minnute, where did Billy put them
    sizzors, I think baby is awoke, and that roast has got to be took out
    of the uven fore it burns.” And then she walked out of the room like a
    thing of life.</p>

  <p>When she was gone, and Missy too, Uncle Ned he stoppd laughin and said:
    “Johnny, you have made a mess of this thing. Its nothin but jest only
    that your sister is a goin to be married.”</p>

  <p>I said would it be for long, and after a while he said: “I give it up,
    ask me a easier one.”</p>

  <p>Last night we had supper late, but I was let stay up, and I et so much
    frute cake that I fell a sleep in my chair at the table, and what do
    you bet I dreamed? I thought I was a settin all alone at a other long
    table, and pretty soon all the animals which I had wrote about come in
    and set theirselfs down in the chairs. There was a ephalent, and a rhi
    nosey rose, and a giraft, and a wale, and a hi potamus, and a eagle,
    and a cammle, and a ostridge, and a big snake, and a rat, and a cow,
    and a ri nupple dinky, and a dog, and a cracky dile, and a munky, and
    evry kind of feller which roams the plain. I said to my own self: “I
    guess this is Noahs ark and its beginnin for to rain.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

  <p>Each animal had its feed before it, what ever it liked best. The
    ephalent had pea nuts, and the bear had ginger bread, and the giraft
    had a wether cock off a steeple, and the ostridge had some black smith
    tools, and the rat it was a eatin some Dutch cheese on a trap, and the
    cow had a holly hock, and the tagger had a cow, and the snake had a
    tagger, and the cracky dile had a natif nigger, you never seen such a
    fine dinner, and Missy was a waitin on the gests with a white veil on
    and some orang owtang blossoms. Jest as she was a passin Jack Brily to
    the shark, the wale, which was eatin scum longside of me at the head
    of the table, stood up on his tail, the wale did, and he had a boat
    full of wine under his fin, like it was a cup. The wale he blowed a
    while, and then he bellerd like a organ, and bime by he spoke up and
    said: “Ladys and gents, it isent any use me tellin you why we have met
    together to night, cause you know all about it. You know, too, that
    we havent ever had a square deal from the relatives of our friend the
    gorilly, which calls theirselfs yuman beins. They have been aginst us
    from the first, and shiver my timbers if I dont believe thay would send
    us all to the bottom if they had the power! Blow me tight, if I wouldnt
    rather be a native of Nantucket than any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> one of them! We hav had only
    but just 2 friends in the whole damb outfit. One was old Noah, which
    wasent any use to me, and the other we have with us this evening, our
    distingished guest, a true friend which under stands us, the only yuman
    bein which has ever saw the point of our jokes and the beauty of our
    moral charackters. Ime sure we all hopes that his yarns mark the dawn
    of a new ery, and men will larn from them that we aint sech bad fellers
    as some of us looks—meanin no offense to my friend the pecock; though
    I dont go so fur as to say that I approove certain dishes which I see
    bein et at this table, particklar by that shark. And now, ladys and
    gents, I have the honor to ask you to join me in drinkin a bumper to
    our ship mate, our guest, our friend, Little Johnny.”</p>

  <p>Then they all stood up and drinked, and then a old rooster, which was
    to the other end of the table, he flopped his wings and crowed out
    “Three cheers for Little Johnny!” which was give by all present, each
    feller in the languidge that he had been teached at his mothers knee.
    This made such a awful noise, that it woked me up, and my sister was a
    pullin my ear for time to go to bed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

  <p>When I was in my bed and she was in hern the door between us was open
    and I said “Missy.”</p>

  <p>She said: “Hold your tungue, you bad boy, what was you a going to say?”</p>

  <p>I said: “Missy, are you a goin to be married?” and she said: “No, you
    little goose, why not?”</p>

  <p>Then I said: “Missy, I know you are, and marryin is poligamy and means
    movin into a other house. When you have done it I want you to do me a
    partickler favor.”</p>

  <p>She said no, indeed she wouldnt, what was it?</p>

  <p>Then I spoke up and said “Missy, when you go for to live in your other
    house I want you to take your young man and let him live there too,
    cause he comes here so much to see Uncle Ned that he is a gum dasted
    nusance!”</p>

  <p>And she said she would if she died for it.</p>

  <p>The Bible it says that fellers which are nusances shall arise from the
    dead. And thats why I say eat drink and be merry, for to-morrow you
    dont. But a pigs tail, nice roasted is the king of beasts.</p>

    say, “We renounce”; I, “We accept.” </p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—Please have the goodness to hold your tongue.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—With both hands, your Excellency.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—Second, Señor, you must assure a liberal government to
    the other islands.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span>—With great pleasure, your Excellency; quite cheerfully.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—Please do not wink. Third, there must be——</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—Excuse me; I was brought up a Spanish subject. What is a
    liberal government?</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—That is for Spain to decide.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—I don’t see what Spain will have to do with it.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—My friend, you slumber—peaceful be thy dreams. Third,
    there must be complete separation of church and state.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span>—What! a Diabolocracy? You shock me!</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—Fourth, none of the islands, nor any part of them, is to
    be ceded to any foreign nation without the consent of the United States.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—You understand, Señor—you hear that! Spain can never again
    acquire a square foot of these islands, not even by reconquest or a
    corrupt bargain with a recreant Filipino dictator, for she will again
    have to reckon with our powerful protectors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> whom may the good God
    reward!</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—The trouble with you is, you talk too much. Fifth, the
    United States must have in the Philippines equal commercial privileges
    with Spain.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—Equal? May I never again run amuck if they shall not have
    superior! Why, I have it in mind to issue a proclamation closing every
    port to the ships of Spain. As to the United States, commercial primacy
    is a small reward for their assistance in the closing scene of our
    successful rebellion.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span>—Of course, as you say, I shall have to accept whatever
    terms you have the great kindness to offer. As I understand your
    proposal, Spain retains all the islands but Luzon; that is to belong to
    the United States, and——</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—What!</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span>—This worthy Oriental appears to be laboring under a
    misapprehension.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—I know of nothing else that could make an Oriental labor.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—Señores, the language of diplomacy is to me an unfamiliar
    tongue: I have imperfectly understood—pardon me. Is it indeed intended
    that the United States shall take Luzon and Spain take all else?</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—“Retain” is the word.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—“Retain?” Why, that means to keep, to hold what is already
    possessed. What you gentlemen have in possession in this archipelago is
    the ground covered by the feet of your soldiers. Now, what right have
    you, Señor Presidente, to the island of Luzon? The right of conquest?
    You have not conquered it.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—My dear fellow, you distress me. I conquered this
    gentleman, and he is going to be good enough to give me the island as a
    testimonial of his esteem.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—But he doesn’t own it. I had taken it away from him before
    you defeated him—all but the capital, and by arrangement with your man
    Dewey——</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span>—Caram——!</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—I assisted to take that. Why, he supplied me with arms for
    the purpose!</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span>—Arms with which I had had the unhappiness to supply
    <i>him</i>.
  </p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—What is my reward? I am driven from the city which I
    assisted to conquer, and you take not only that but the entire island,
    which you had no hand in conquering.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span> (<i>aside</i>)—Faith! he’ll conquer it before he gets it.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—My friend, you are a Malay, with a slight infusion of
    Chinese, Hindu and Kanaka. Naturally, you cannot understand these high
    matters.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—I understand this: We Filipinos rebelled against Spain
    to liberate our country from oppression. We wrested island after
    island, city after city, from her until Manila was virtually all that
    she had left. As we were about to deprive her of that and regain the
    independence which, through four hundred years of misrule, she had
    denied us we experienced a dire mischance. You quarreled with her
    because she denied independence to Cuba. Spanish dominion, which we
    had stabbed, was already dead, but you arrived just in time to kick
    the corpse while it was yet warm, and for this service you propose to
    administer upon the estate, keeping the most valuable part for your
    honesty. You will then revive the dead, buried and damned and reinstate
    him in possession of the remainder!</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span> (<i>aside</i>)—O, will I?</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span>—Apparently, Señor Presidente, this worthy person is
    afflicted with a flow of language. (<i>Aside</i>) The Porco Americano
    has the habit of blushing.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span> (<i>to Sagasta</i>)—Yes, the Filipino always has his
    tongue in his ear. (<i>To Aguinaldo</i>) Proceed with the address.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—It is as if the French, having assisted your forefathers
    to independence, had kept Boston and all New England for themselves and
    restored the other colonies to Great Britain. If the Good Samaritan,
    arriving while the man fallen among thieves was still struggling with
    them, had assisted him to beat them off, had then taken his purse and
    delivered him to the thieves again you would have had a Scriptural
    precedent.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sag.</span> (<i>writing in a notebook</i>)—“At a certain temperature
    the Porco Americano can sweat.”</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—My great and good friend, you seem to have your climate
    with you, as well as your chin. I must beg you to abridge your oration
    against manifest destiny.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—Destiny was a long time manifesting herself, but she
    has not been idle since. In the last four months you have torn up
    the three American political Holy Scriptures: Washington’s Farewell
    Address, the Monroe Doctrine and the Declaration of Independence. You
    now stand upon the fragments of the last and declare it an error <span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>that
    governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.
    In Hawaii you are founding a government on the consent of less than
    three per centum of the governed. In my country you propose to found
    one government and restore another against the unanimous dissent of
    eight millions of people whom you cheated into an alliance to that end.
    You cajoled them into assisting at the cutting of their own throats.
    Your only justification in making this war at all was Spain’s denial in
    Havana of the political principle which you now repudiate in Honolulu
    and Manila. Señores, we shall resist both the American and the Spanish
    occupation. You will be allies—embrace!</p>

  <p class="right">[<i>Exit Sagasta.</i>]</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—My dear boy, you are unduly alarmed: the notion
    of letting Spain keep those other islands is merely a Proposal
    Retractable—in undiplomatic language, an offer with a string to it.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—And your plan of holding Luzon—after taking it?</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">McK.</span>—Rest in peace: that is only what we call an Intention
    Augmentable.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ag.</span>—Ah, Señor, you make me so happy! </p>

    precautions to secure secrecy were taken, but it is understood that
    German aggression in Brazil was discussed, and nothing is more

    movements of our war ships in both the North and the South Atlantic.
    Senator Lodge’s recent alarming speech on the Navy Appropriation Bill
    is recalled, in connection with this subject, as is also Senator
    Pettigrew’s significant silence. Nor is it forgotten that last week

  <p><span class="smcap">Czar</span>—What! Is it so serious as that? My poor friend, I am

    on one of the days before yesterday.</p>

    Mr. Secretary, how about the exclusion of Japs from the Californian

  <p><span class="smcap">Metcalf</span>—There are separate schools for them. The average age

  <p><span class="smcap">Second American Sovereign</span>—What’s the matter with you?</p>

  <p>F. A. S.—What’s the matter with me? What’s the matter with all of us?
    Don’t you see the President’s train? Don’t you hear him speaking from
    the rear platform?</p>

  <p>S. A. S.—What’s to prevent?</p>

  <p>F. A. S.—Nothing could prevent—not all the crowned heads of Europe, nor
    all their sycophant courtiers and servile subjects!</p>

  <p>S. A. S.—No, nothing—just nothing at all—excepting personal
    self-respect and a decent sense of the dignity of American citizenship.</p>

  <p>F. A. S.—What! You think it base and undignified to pay honor to the
    President’s great office?</p>

  <p>S. A. S.—It is easy to call it “honoring his great office.” I believe
    we commonly do give the name of some virtue to our besetting vice. I
    observe that the President, too, honors our own great office by the
    most sickening flattery of the people every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span> time he opens his mouth.
    His reasons are better than ours, for we really rank him: his great
    office is of our own making and bestowal. But I wish he wouldn’t lick
    my boots.</p>

  <p>F. A. S.—Sir, you have no right to use such language of the ruler of
    the nation!</p>

  <p>S. A. S.—It is “ruler” when you want an excuse to grovel; in your more
    austere moods it is “servant of the people”—and that is his own name
    for the thing that he has the distinction to be. I don’t cheer my
    butler, nor throw flowers at my coachman, nor crush the hand of my cook.</p>

  <p>F. A. S. (<i>aside</i>)—This must be a millionaire! (<i>Aloud</i>) I

    he can bawl</i>) Hooray! Hooray!</p>

  <h4>OUR HISTORICAL NOVELS</h4>

  <div class="mt3"><i>From “The First Man in Rome.”</i></div>

  <p class="drop-cap mt0">NO sooner had Cæsar crossed the Rubicon than all Rome was ablaze with
    excitement and terror. Horatius, who all by himself had held the bridge
    until outnumbered, retreated to the Tiber, where he was joined by the
    new levies, imperfectly armed and equipped, and some of the Prætorian
    Guards. There, behind such defenses as they could improvise, they swore
    to resist until all were dead. Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and
    the augurs, removing the hearts of the victims, consulted the auricles.</p>

  <p>Meantime Cæsar’s leading legion, with Scipio Africanus marching proudly
    at its head, came into view beyond the Tarpeian Rock—the same from
    which the unhappy Sappho, one of the most prominent poets of her time,
    had cast herself—and advanced without delay in a shower of catapults.</p>

  <p>Precisely what occurred during the next half-hour we are without the
    data to state with confidence: all the historical novels of the three
    or four centuries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span> immediately following were destroyed in the accident
    at Pompeii; but at three o’clock in the afternoon of that fateful
    day Brutus lay dead upon the field of honor and the beaten forces of
    Horatius were in tumultuous retreat along the Claudian aqueduct. Then
    Cleopatra came forth from her place of concealment, resolved to throw
    herself at the feet of her conquering lover and intercede for the
    doomed city.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “Court and Camp.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">Through a tangled wild as dense as death the martial forced his way,
    despite the wounds that the Russian forces had inflicted upon his aged
    frame. Suddenly he departed from the undergrowth and found himself
    in an open glade of inconsiderable dimensions, and before his vision
    stood the widely known figure of Napoleon, with folded arms and in a
    greatcoat falling to his heels. The king was apparently oblivious to
    his environment, but instinctively “the bravest of the brave,” ever
    considerate and genteel, drew back into cover, unwilling to interrupt
    the royal revery. Apparently Napoleon was immersed in meditations.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

  <p>What these were we have not the temerity to conjecture. Waterloo had
    been fought and lost!—the last die had been cast to the winds and
    the dream of universal empire had gone down in gloom! Did he realize
    that all was over? Was he conjuring up the future and forecasting the
    judgment of posterity—the figure that he was destined to cut in the
    historical novels of a later age? Did visions of St. Helena float
    before his prophetic gaze? Alas, we know not!</p>

  <p>At the sound of a breaking twig beneath the martial’s foot the king
    started from his revery and said in French: “Live the France!” Then,
    deriving a slender stiletto from his regalia, he plunged it into the
    left ventricle of his heart and fell dead before the martial, who was
    greatly embarrassed, could summon medical assistance.</p>

  <p>Josephine was avenged!</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “The Crusader.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">It was midnight beneath the walls of the beleaguered city. Sir Guy de
    Chassac de Carcassonne leaned heavily upon his great two-handed sword,
    fatigued with slaughter. Hardly had he closed his eyes in slumber when
    the seven Saracens chosen by Saladin for the perilous emprise stole
    forth from the postern gate and stealthily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span> surrounded him. Then at a
    preconcerted signal they flashed their scimitars in air and rushed upon
    their prey!</p>

  <p>But it was fated to be otherwise. At the first stroke of the Toledo
    blades Sir Guy awoke. To pluck his long weapon from the soil was the
    work of a comparatively short time; then with one mighty circular sweep
    of the steel he clove them all asunder at the waist!</p>

  <p>Jerusalem was delivered and remains a Christian city to this day!</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “Blood and Beer.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">The booming of the cannon awakened Bismarck with a start. Vaulting
    into the saddle with remarkable grace, he was soon in the thickest
    of the fray, and many a foeman fell beneath his genius. Yet even in
    the terrible din and confusion of battle his mental processes were
    normal, and he thought only of the countess, while absently dealing
    death about him. Suddenly he was roused from his revery by the impact
    of a battle-axe upon his helmet, and turning his eyes in the direction
    whence it seemed to have been delivered, he beheld the sneering visage
    of De Grammont on a black steed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

  <p>Here was an opportunity that might satisfy the most exacting—an
    opportunity to rid his country of a traitor and himself of a rival;
    to serve at once his ambition and his love. His noble nature forbade.
    Waving his enemy aside, he thoughtfully withdrew from the field,
    resolved to press his suit otherwise.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “The Iron Duchess.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">As Wellington rode moodily away from the fatal field of Blenheim,
    meditating upon the wreck of his ambition, he encountered the seer whom
    he had met the day before.</p>

  <p>“Wretch!” he exclaimed, drawing his scimitar, “it is you that have done
    this! But for your accursed predictions I should have won the battle
    and the Swiss king would now be flying before my victorious legends.
    Die, therefore!”</p>

  <p>So saying, he raised his armed hand to smite, but the blow did not
    fall. Even while the blade was suspended in the air the seer’s long
    black cloak fell away, the white hair and concealing beard were flung
    aside, and the Iron Duke found himself gazing into the laughing eyes of
    Madame de Maintenon! Speechless with astonishment, he thundered: “What
    is the meaning of this?”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

  <p>“Ah, monsieur,” she replied, with that enchanting smile which had lured
    Louis XIV to the guillotine, “it means that I amuse myself.”</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “The Noddle of Navarre.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">When Henry of Navarre saw the ruin he had wrought he elevated his
    helmet from his marble brow and stepped three paces to the rear. The
    priest advanced with flashing eyes and, lifting both hands to the
    zenith, explained that vengeance was the Lord’s—He would repay!</p>

  <p>“It is better so,” assented the king—“I prefer it thus.”</p>

  <p>But even as he spake a shot from the moat pierced his brain and he
    fell, to reign no more!</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “Louis the Luckless.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">Observing that his presence was not suspected, Richelieu remained with
    his eye glued to the keyhole. It was well that he did so, for the
    conspirators now laid off their masks, and among them he recognized
    the king himself! Here was a situation that he believed unique; in all
    his experience in court and camp there was no precedent A sovereign
    conspiring for his own overthrow, his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>assassination! Richelieu was
    deeply affected by so striking an instance of unselfishness. He reeled
    and fell to the floor in an agony of admiration.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “The Road to Tusculum.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">No sooner did Cicero perceive his legions retreating than he spurred
    impetuously from the field, thundering that all was lost. Passing
    swiftly across the Tiber by a secret bridge, he proceeded to the
    Forum, and entering the senate unannounced, communicated the news of
    the disaster. This was Pompey’s opportunity; he rose in his place and
    extending his index finger in the direction of the defeated warrior
    exclaimed in sarcastic accents: “Romans, behold your liberator from
    the chains of the Volscians! Behold the orator-general to whom you
    owe so much! Let him hereafter (if we have a hereafter) oppose to
    his country’s armed invaders the power of his matchless tongue. The
    sword is too heavy for a hand trained in the light calisthenics of
    gesticulation!” Maddened by this artful arraignment, the senators rose
    as one Roman and, headed by Marcus Aurelius, fell upon the unfortunate
    commander, tearing him limb from limb!</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “The Loves of Cromwell.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">Night fell darkly over the city of Worcester.</p>

  <p>Cromwell had marched all day to reach it by seven roads, and at nine in
    the evening besieged it with a hundred thousand men.</p>

  <p>A desperate struggle ensued, at the close of which Cromwell rose from
    his knees victorious over the forces of his king.</p>

  <p>“Bring that son of Belial before me!” he roared, “that I may deal with
    him according to his sins.”</p>

  <p>Charles, pale and trembling, with manacled hands and bowed head, was led in.</p>

  <p>The lord protector eyed him haughtily, then addressing a brief prayer
    to Heaven sprang forward and with one stroke of his blade severed the
    royal head from the royal shoulders.</p>

  <p>Thus ended the War of the Roses, and England was again a republic.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span></p>
  <h4 id="OUR_TALES_OF_SENTIMENT">OUR TALES OF SENTIMENT</h4>

  <div class="mt3"><i>From “One Woman.”</i></div>

  <p class="drop-cap mt0">GLADYS climbed to the balustrade of the bridge and, adjusting her
    skirts, plunged into the gloomiest forebodings.</p>

  <p>“Why,” she said, “should the future look so dark to one possessing all
    that fortune can donate?”</p>

  <p>She added a number of profound reflections on the vanity of life,
    ending with a brilliant epigram. It had scarcely died upon her lips
    when Armitage arrived upon the tapis and took in the situation at a
    glance. Striding hastily forward, he bowed gracefully and signified
    a desire to know the cause of her abstraction. She burst into tears
    and complied with his wish. Then she flung herself about his neck and
    accorded full expression to her grief, which he delicately professed
    not to observe; for this noble figure had been educated in the best
    schools of European gentility.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “But a Single Thought.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">Seeing her proceeding away from him, perhaps forever, Auvergne
    intercepted her with an expression of regret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> for his rudeness, coupled
    with a plea for pardon. For a breathless instant she stayed her
    progress as if uncertain as to the degree of his offense, then resumed
    her pace till she reached the river’s brim. With an unconscious prayer
    she sprang swooning into the breakers and was with difficulty prevented
    from meeting a watery grave.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “A Belle of Castile.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">Josephina had progressed but a brief distance into the garden when
    some inner sense proclaimed that she was followed: the crunching of a
    gentleman’s heel upon the gravel was indisputable. Partially terrified,
    she sought concealment in the shrubbery that bordered the path on the
    one side and the other. It passed by her there in the moonlight, that
    dreadful sound, yet no one visible! It went on and on, growing fainter
    and fainter, like herself, and was lost to hearing. Then she remembered
    the tradition of the Invisible Knight and her heart smote her for the
    absence of faith with which she had so often greeted it.</p>

  <p>“I am fitly punished,” she conceded, “for my sceptical attitude.
    Henceforth, so far as the constitution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span> my mind will permit, I will
    be more hospitable to the convictions of the simple.”</p>

  <p>How she adhered to this expiational resolution we shall behold.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “The Queen’s Chaperon.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">The duke stepped from his carriage to a neighboring hill and cast
    his eye athwart his ancestral domain. “All this,” he mused, “I must
    renounce if I comply with the queen’s royal suggestion to fly with her
    to Rome. Is she worth the privation? I must have time to consider a
    transaction of such great importance.”</p>

  <p>Hastily entering his carriage, he haughtily bade the coachman drive him
    to some expensive hotel, whence he dispatched a delicately perfumed
    note to her Majesty, saying that he should be detained a few days by
    affairs of state, but assuring her of his uncommon fidelity. Then he
    retired to his couch and thought it all over in Italian. The next day
    he arose and fled rapidly.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “The Uplifting of Lennox.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">On hearing the terrible news Myra fell supine to earth without delay! </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

  <p>“Is it nothing?” inquired Lennox. “Is it only a temporary
    indisposition?—will it soon pass?”</p>

  <p>But Myra replied only with a significant pallor which told all too
    plainly what the most accomplished linguist would vainly have striven
    to express.</p>

  <p>How long she lay unconscious we know not, but promptly on becoming her
    previous self she let fall a multitude of tears.</p>

  <p>Lennox yielded to the requirements of etiquette and stole away.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “Bertha of Bootha.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">As they strolled along the Riviera the setting sun was just touching
    the summit of the Alps and firing them with an electrical glow. Turning
    to her, he looked into her beautiful eyes and thus expressed himself:</p>

  <p>“Dearest, I am about to make an important statement.”</p>

  <p>She almost instantly divined the character of the communication that he
    referred to, and it affected her with perturbation. It was so sudden.
    “If,” she remarked, “you could postpone the statement above mentioned
    until a more suitable occasion I should regard your forbearance with satisfaction.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

  <p>“Very well,” he replied, with coldness, “I will wait until we are not alone.”</p>

  <p>“Thank you, ever so much,” she blushed, and all was silence. Later in
    the season he explained to her the trend of his affections, and she
    signified the pleasure that she derived from his preference.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “Hertha of Hootha.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">The moon rose in the east without a sound and the ripples on the bosom
    of the main ran silently to the beach. Hertha and Henri, having similar
    sensibilities, were equally overcome by the solemnity of the scene,
    and neither inaugurated a conversation. Their love was too true for
    utterance by human tongue. Thus they paced for a considerable period,
    when suddenly the silence was cut asunder by a woman’s scream!</p>

  <p>“I know that voice,” cried Henri, hastily divesting himself of as many
    of his upper garments as, under the circumstances, he deemed it proper
    to do; “it is Minetta committing suicide!”</p>

  <p>He immediately plunged into the Atlantic, while Hertha stood rooted to
    the sand, endeavoring to regulate her emotions. In a few moments, which
    seemed an age, he emerged from the deep, bearing the deceased, whom he
    tenderly flung at her rival’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span> feet.</p>

  <p>Then the survivors knelt and prayed in both English and French.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “Ethel Shanks.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">Ethel hastened slowly along the path leading to the cliff above the
    lake. The full moon was rising in the east, for the hour was midnight,
    and her warm radiance bathed the landscape in a blue languor.</p>

  <p>To Ethel the sky had never seemed so blue, nor the Polyanthes tuberosa
    in her corsage so white. She drank joy with her every breath, and
    she breathed quickly from her exertion in climbing the eminence on
    which she stood. Hearing footprints approaching, she turned, and the
    baron stood before her! “I was hasty,” he explained. “I should not
    have disclosed my love with such abruption. Permit me to withdraw my
    inconsiderate declaration.”</p>

  <p>Ethel’s heart sank within her! She could not refuse him the desired
    permission; that would not have been genteel: and Ethel was under all
    circumstances the lady. So she beat back the tears and said:</p>

  <p>“Please, sir, dismiss it from attention.” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>

  <p>The cry of her broken heart was unheard by that callous ear,
    unaccustomed to the sad, sweet chords evoked from the harp of a dead
    hope. The nobleman lit his pipe and, his cruel errand performed,
    returned to his ancestral mansion. For one or two moments Ethel stood
    on the brink of eternity. Precipitating herself from the extreme edge,
    she awaited death with composure; she had done her full duty and had no
    fear of the Hereafter.... At the base of the precipice she came into
    violent contact with a large granite boulder and was no more.</p>

  <p>They found her body at the feet of the cliff, and the baron was torn by
    conflicting emotions, for the head lay at some distance from the trunk,
    a truly melancholy spectacle.</p>

  <p>“Can it be possible,” he remarked, “that she is no more?”</p>

  <p>Assured by the physician that such was the fact, he signified a high
    degree of regret and strode from the spot unattended; and to this day
    his fate is cloaked in the impenetrable waters of oblivion.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “A Demising Love.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">James endeavored ineffectually to ascertain the trend of her
    affections: her expression remained a blank. He erroneously attributed
    his failure to poor skill in physiognomy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> and inwardly bewailed his
    youthful neglect of the advantages of education. While so engaged he
    fancied he detected in her look something significant of an interest in
    his personality. Could he be mistaken? No, there it was again!</p>

  <p>Arising from his sedentary attitude to the full stature of his young
    manhood, he crossed the intervening Persian rug and possessed himself
    of her hand.</p>

  <p>“Mabel,” he inquired, “do you not experience the promptings of a
    dawning tenderness for one to whom you are much?”</p>

  <p>Receiving no negative answer he kissed her simultaneously on both
    cheeks, and, falling rapidly upon one knee, poured out his soul
    in beautiful language, mostly devoted to commendation of her fine
    character and disposition.</p>

  <p>Mabel did not at once respond. She was deceased.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “March Hares.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">Mrs. Rorqual deposited her embroidery on the sofa by her side and,
    slightly changing color, said, “No, my ideals are not unchangeable;
    they have undergone memorable alteration within the last hour.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

  <p>“Let us hope,” said D’Anchovi, uncrossing his hands, and putting one
    forefinger into a buttonhole of his coat, “that they are still high.”</p>

  <p>She resumed her embroidery and, looking at a painting of the martyrdom
    of St. Denis over the mantel, replied, “Would it matter?”</p>

  <p>“Surely,” said he, lightly beating the carpet with the heel of his
    well-fitting shoe; “for ideals are more than thoughts. I sometimes
    think they are things—that <i>we</i> are <i>their</i> thoughts.”</p>

  <p>She did not immediately reply. A curtain at an open window moved
    audibly. A sunbeam crept through the lattice of the piazza outside and
    fell upon the window-ledge. The fly previously mentioned now walked
    indolently along the top of the Japanese screen, then fearlessly
    descended the face of it to within an inch of the mouth of a painted
    frog. D’Anchovi, with a lifting of his eyebrows, maintained a
    determined silence.</p>

  <p>“I should think that an uncomfortable creed,” Mrs. Rorqual said at
    last, withdrawing the tip of her shoe, which had been visible beneath
    the edge of her gown, and shifting her gaze from St. Denis to one of
    the crystal ornaments of the candelabrum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span> pendent from the ceiling.</p>

  <p>He passed the fingers of his right hand through his hair, slightly
    shifted his position on his chair and said: “Mrs. Rorqual, I have to
    thank you for a most agreeable hour. Shall I see you on the golf-links to-morrow?”</p>

  <p>So they parted, but when he was gone she toyed thoughtfully with
    a spray of heliotrope growing in a jardinière and then ran her
    forefinger along a part of the pattern of the wallpaper.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “A Study in Dissection.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">Captain Gerard introspected. He spread his heart, as it were, upon the
    dissecting-table of conscience and examined it from several points of
    view. It is a familiar act—we call it analysis of motive. When he had
    concluded he knew why he had accepted the invitation of the countess
    to dinner. He knew why he had insulted the count. Equally obvious were
    his reasons for mentioning to Iphigeneia the holy bonds of matrimony.
    In all his conduct since his last introspection but one act baffled
    him: why, alas, had he spoken to Iphigeneia of the bar-semester in his
    crest? </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

  <p>As he pondered this inexplicable problem a footfall fell upon his ear
    and he shuddered as if the hand of death had stepped in.</p>

  <p>It was the countess!</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “Her Diplodocus.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">“Sir!” Miss Athylton drew herself up to her full height and looked her
    interlocutor squarely in the visage. For an instant he returned her
    scrutiny; then his eyes fell to the earth, stammering apologies. With a
    sweeping curtsey she passed out of the room, hand over hand.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “L’Affaire Smith.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">As they sat there wrapping their arms about each other, she advanced
    the belief that they had loved in a former state of existence.</p>

  <p>“But not as now, Irene, surely not as now.”</p>

  <p>She was well content to let him feel so about it, and did not seek
    to alter the character of his emotion. To have done so would have
    cut her to the heart. On the contrary, a little bird perched in the
    passion-vine above them and sang several thrilling passages.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “Clarisse.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">He gazed into her beautiful eyes for a considerable period, during
    which he did not converse; then he said, with an effort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span> to be
    sociable: “It has been represented to me that you are a lady of great
    wealth. May I inquire if I have been rightly informed?”</p>

  <p>Blushing energetically at the compliment, she replied in silence, and
    for a few minutes there was an embarrassing hiatus in the exchange of
    thought and feeling.</p>

  <p>Fearing that he had offended her, the duke arose, and striding to the
    grand piano began to improvise diligently. At that moment there came in
    through the open window a sound of wheels on the gravel outside.</p>

  <p>He ceased in the middle of a nocturne and would have left the room, but
    she restrained him:</p>

  <p>“It is only my father returning from India,” smiled she; “I shall be so
    glad to introduce you.”</p>

  <p>The full horror of the situation burst upon him like a thunderbolt out
    of a clean sky.</p>

  <p>“Madam,” he thundered, “your father is dead! He died of the plague in
    Bombay, and I attended the funeral, although he had cursed me with his
    last breath. I cannot—cannot meet him!”</p>

  <p>With those words falling from his white lips he flung himself out of
    the room. A servant entered and handed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>Clarisse the visiting card of
    Mrs. Delahanty.</p>

  <div class="mt3 mb0"><i>From “Mary Ann &amp; Co.”</i></div>

  <p class="mt0">As they neared each other on the narrow bridge Paul observed that she
    was profoundly agitated.</p>

  <p>“Darling,” he said, “please to signify the cause of your perturbation.
    It is not impossible that I may be able to remove it. You know,” he
    added, “that I have studied medicine.”</p>

  <p>She blushed deeply, then turned pale and continued to tremble. He
    seized her hand and laid two fingers upon her wrist.</p>

  <p>“The pulse,” he said, “is abnormally frequent and irregular.”</p>

  <p>With a barely audible expression of disapproval, she withdrew her
    hand and endeavored to pass him on the narrow footway of the bridge.
    A misstep precipitated her into the stream, from which with no small
    difficulty she was taken in a dying condition, a half-mile below. The
    person that drew her forth from the waters was Paul’s aged uncle.</p>

  <p>“Tell Paul Dessard,” she said with her last breath, “that I love him,

  <p>Janey was beautiful all day long. Her hair was as dark as the pinion of

    on the bosom of the river. She was also a fine French scholar.</p>

  <p>Janey’s parents had dwelt in Yonkers from time immemorial, and sweet

    coroneted hearts had been flung at her feet—many were the impassionate
    pleas that ducal lips had poured into her ear; she remained fancy
    free, determined to bestow her affection upon some worthy member of an
    American labor union or die a maid. We shall see with what indomitable
    tenacity she adhered through disheartening trials to that commendable policy.</p>

  <p class="mt0">For a long time—it seemed an eternity—they sat there hand in hand,
    in the gloaming. The sheep-bells tinkled faintly in the glen, and
    from an adjacent thicket the whip-poor-will sang rapturously. The
    katydid grated out her mysterious accusation from the branch of an oak
    overhead; the cricket droned among the glow-worms underfoot. All these
    vocal efforts were conspicuously futile; in their newly found happiness
    the lovers heeded nothing but each other. O love!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, on the dew-starred sward, a loud oath rang out behind them.
    Harold rose promptly to his own feet, the lady remaining in session on

    without medical assistance.</p>

  <p>Harold mounted the log and obtained a fairly good view of the
    aggressor; it was James Wroth, and he was engaged in taking a second
    aim. With the lightning-like intuition of a brave man in an emergency
    Harold inferred that he was the intended victim.</p>

  <p>“Fiend!” sprang he, and a death struggle was inaugurated without delay.</p>

  <p>Let us go back to the time when we left James Wroth nourishing the
    fires of an intellectual tempest implanted by Miss Mercer’s rejection
    of his suit, and embarking for Europe in another tongue.</p>

    <h3 id="THE_GREAT_STRIKE_OF_1895">THE GREAT STRIKE OF 1895</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">NEW YORK, July 2, 1895.—The strike of the American Authors’
    Guild continues to hold public attention. No event in the history
    of trades-unionism since the great railroad strike of last year has
    equaled it in interest. Nothing else is talked of here. In some parts
    of the city all business is suspended and the excitement grows more
    intense hourly.</p>

  <p>At about 10 o’clock this morning a non-union author attempting to enter
    the premises of D. Appleton &amp; Co. with a roll of manuscript was set
    upon by a mob of strikers and beaten into insensibility. The strikers
    were driven from their victim by the police, but only after a fight in
    which both sides suffered severely.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, July 3.—Rioting was renewed last night in front of
    the boycotted publishing house of Charles Scribner’s Sons, 153–157
    Fifth avenue. Though frequently driven back by charges of the police,
    who used their clubs freely, the striking authors succeeded in
    demolishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span> all the front windows by stone-throwing. One shot was
    fired into the interior, narrowly missing a young lady typewriter. Mr.
    William D. Howells, a member of the Guild’s board of managers, declares
    that he has irrefragable proof that this outrage was committed by some
    one connected with the Publishers’ Protective League for the purpose of
    creating public sympathy.</p>

  <p>It has been learned that the non-union author so severely beaten
    yesterday died of his injuries last night. His name is said to have
    been Richard Henry (or Hengist) Stoddard, formerly a member of the
    Guild, but expelled for denouncing the action of President Brander
    Matthews in ordering the strike.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Matters look more and more threatening. A crowd of
    ten thousand authors, headed by Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, is
    reported to be marching upon the Astor Library, which is strongly
    guarded by police, heavily armed. Many book-stores have been wrecked
    and their contents destroyed.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, who was shot last night while setting fire to the
    establishment of Harper &amp; Bros., cannot recover. She is delirious, and
    lies on her cot in the Bellevue Hospital singing “The Battle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span> Hymn of
    the Republic.”</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, July 3.—Industrial discontent has broken out here. The
    members of the local branch of the American Authors’ Guild threw down
    their pens this morning and declared that until satisfactory settlement
    of novelists’ percentages should be arrived at not a hero and heroine
    should live happily ever afterward in Boston. The publishing house of
    Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co. is guarded by a detachment of Pinkerton men
    armed with Winchester rifles and a Gatling gun. The publishers say that
    they are getting all the manuscripts that they are able to reject, and
    profess to have no apprehension as to the future. Mr. Joaquin Miller,
    a non-union poet from Nevada, visiting some Indian relatives here,
    was terribly beaten by a mob of strikers to-day. Mr. Miller was the
    aggressor; he was calling them “sea-doves”—by which he is said to have
    meant “gulls.”</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Chicago</span>, July 3.—The authors’ strike is assuming alarming
    dimensions and is almost beyond control by the police. The Mayor
    is strongly urged to ask for assistance from the militia, but the
    strikers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span> profess to have no fear of his doing so. They say that he was
    once an author himself, and is in sympathy with them. He wrote “The
    Beautiful Snow.” In the mean time a mob of strikers numbering not fewer
    than one thousand men, women and children, headed by such determined
    labor leaders as Percival Pollard and Hamlin Garland, are parading
    the streets and defying the authorities. A striker named Opie Reed,
    arrested yesterday for complicity in the assassination of Mr. Stone, of
    the publishing firm of Stone &amp; Kimball, was released by this mob from
    the officers that had him in custody. Mr. Pollard publishes a letter in
    the <i>Herald</i> this morning saying that Mr. Stone was assassinated
    by an emissary of the Publishers’ Protective League to create public
    sympathy, and strongly hints that the assassin is the head of the house
    of McClurg &amp; Co.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, July 4.—All arrangements for celebrating the
    birthday of American independence are “off.” The city is fearfully
    excited, and scenes of violence occur hourly. Macmillan &amp; Co.’s
    establishment was burned last night, and four lives were lost in
    the flames. The loss of property is variously estimated. All the
    publishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span> houses are guarded by the militia, and it is said that
    Government troops will land this afternoon to protect the United
    States mails carrying the manuscripts of strike-breaking authors,
    in transit to publishers. The destruction of the Astor Library and
    the Cooper Union and the closing of all the book-stores that escaped
    demolition in yesterday’s rioting have caused sharp public distress.
    No similar book-famine has ever been known in this city. Novel-readers
    particularly, their needs being so imperative, are suffering severely,
    and unless relieved soon will leave the metropolis. While beating a
    noisy person named E. W. Townsend last night, one Richard Harding
    Davis had the misfortune to break two of his fingers. He said Townsend
    was a strike-breaker and had given information to the police, but it
    turns out that he is a zealous striker, and was haranguing the mob at
    the time of the assault. His audience of rioting authors, all of whom
    belonged to the War Story branch of the Guild, mistook Mr. Davis for
    an officer of the peace and ran away. Mr. Townsend, who cannot recover
    and apparently does not wish to, is said to be the author of a popular
    book called <i>The Chimney Fadder</i>. Advices from Boston relate the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>death of a Pinkerton spy named T. B. Aldrich, who attempted to run
    the gauntlet of union pickets and enter the premises of The Arena
    Publishing Company, escorting Walter Blackburn Harte. Mr. Harte was
    rescued by the police and sailed at once for England.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, July 5.—A mob of striking authors attacked the
    publishing house of J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. this morning and were fired
    on by the militia. Twenty are known to have been killed outright—the
    largest number of writers ever immortalized at one time.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, July 5.—In an interview yesterday Mrs. Louise
    Chandler Moulton, treasurer of the Guild, said that notwithstanding
    the heavy expense of maintaining needy strikers with dependent
    families, there would be no lack of funds to carry on the fight.
    Contributions are received daily from sympathetic trades. Sixty dollars
    have been sent in by the Confederated Undertakers and forty-five by
    the Association of Opium-Workers. President Brander Matthews has
    telegraphed to all the Guild’s branches in other cities that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> can
    beat the game if they will stand pat.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, July 6.—Sympathy strikes are the order of the day,
    and “risings” are reported everywhere. In this city the entire East
    Side is up and out. Shantytown, Ballyspalpeen, Goatville and Niggernest
    are in line. Among those killed in yesterday’s conflict with the United
    States troops at Madison-square was Mark Twain, who fell while cheering
    on a large force of women of the town. He was shot all to rags, so as
    to be hardly distinguishable from a human being.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Chicago</span>, July 7.—John Vance Cheney was arrested at 3 o’clock
    this morning while placing a dynamite bomb on the Clark-street bridge.
    He is believed to have entertained the design, also, of setting the
    river on fire. Two publishers were shot this morning by General Lew
    Wallace, who escaped in the confusion of the incident. The victims were
    employed as accountants in the Methodist Book Concern.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, July 8.—The authors’ strike has collapsed, and the
    strikers are seeking employment as waiters in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>the places made vacant
    by the lockout of the Restaurant Trust. The Publishers’ Protective
    League declares that no author concerned in the strike will ever again
    see his name upon a title-page. The American Authors’ Guild is a thing
    of the past. Arrests are being made every hour. As soon as he can
    procure bail, President Brander Matthews will go upon the vaudeville stage.</p>

    <h3 id="A_THUMB_NAIL_SKETCH">A THUMB-NAIL SKETCH</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">MANY years ago I lived in Oakland, California. One day as I lounged in
    my lodging there was a gentle, hesitating rap at the door and, opening
    it, I found a young man, the youngest young man, it seemed to me, that
    I had ever confronted. His appearance, his attitude, his manner, his
    entire personality suggested extreme diffidence. I did not ask him in,
    instate him in my better chair (I had two) and inquire how we could
    serve each other. If my memory is not at fault I merely said: “Well,”
    and awaited the result.</p>

  <p>“I am from the San Francisco <i>Examiner</i>,” he explained in a voice
    like the fragrance of violets made audible, and backed a little away.</p>

  <p>“O,” I said, “you come from Mr. Hearst.”</p>

  <p>Then that unearthly child lifted its blue eyes and cooed: “I am Mr. Hearst.”</p>

  <p>His father had given him a daily newspaper and he had come to hire
    me to write for it. Twenty years of what his newspapers call “wage
    slavery” ensued, and although I had many a fight with his editors
    for my right to my self-respect, I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>cannot say that I ever found Mr.
    Hearst’s chain a very heavy burden, though indubitably I suffered
    somewhat in social repute for wearing it.</p>

  <p>If ever two men were born to be enemies he and I are they. Each stands
    for everything that is most disagreeable to the other, yet we never
    clashed. I never had the honor of his friendship and confidence, never
    was “employed about his person,” and seldom entered the editorial
    offices of his newspapers. He did not once direct nor request me to
    write an opinion that I did not hold, and only two or three times
    suggested that I refrain for a season from expressing opinions that
    I did hold, when they were antagonistic to the policy of the paper,
    as they commonly were. During several weeks of a great labor strike
    in California, when mobs of ruffians stopped all railway trains,
    held the state capital and burned, plundered and murdered at will,
    he “laid me off,” continuing, of course, my salary; and some years
    later, when striking employees of street railways were devastating St.
    Louis, pursuing women through the street and stripping them naked, he
    suggested that I “let up on that labor crowd.” No other instances of
    “capitalistic arrogance” occur to memory. I do not know that any <span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>of
    his other writers enjoyed a similar liberty, or would have enjoyed it
    if they had had it. Most of them, indeed, seemed to think it honorable
    to write anything that they were expected to.</p>

  <p>As to Mr. Hearst’s own public writings, I fancy there are none: he
    could not write an advertisement for a lost dog. The articles that he
    signs and the speeches that he makes—well, if a man of brains is one
    who knows how to use the brains of others this amusing demagogue is
    nobody’s dunce.</p>

  <p>If asked to justify my long service to journals with whose policies I
    was not in agreement and whose character I loathed I should confess
    that possibly the easy nature of the service had something to do with
    it. As to the point of honor (as that is understood in the profession)
    the editors and managers always assured me that there was commercial
    profit in employing my rebellious pen; and I—O well, I persuaded myself
    that I could do most good by addressing those who had greatest need of
    me—the millions of readers to whom Mr. Hearst was a misleading light.
    Perhaps this was an erroneous view of the matter; anyhow I am not
    sorry that, discovering no preservative allowable under the pure food
    law that would enable <span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>him to keep his word overnight, I withdrew,
    and can now, without impropriety, speak my mind of him as freely as
    his generosity, sagacity or indifference once enabled me to do of his
    political and industrial doctrines, in his own papers.</p>

  <p>In illustration of some of the better features of this man’s strange
    and complex character let this incident suffice. Soon after the
    assassination of Governor Goebel of Kentucky—which seemed to me a
    particularly perilous “precedent” if unpunished—I wrote for one of Mr.
    Hearst’s New York newspapers the following prophetic lines:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">The bullet that pierced Goebel’s breast</div>
        <div class="i0">Can not be found in all the West.</div>
        <div class="i0">Good reason: it is speeding here</div>
        <div class="i0">To stretch McKinley on the bier.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The lines took no attention, naturally, but twenty months afterward the
    President was shot by Czolgosz. Every one remembers what happened then
    to Mr. Hearst and his newspapers. His political enemies and business
    competitors were alert to their opportunity. The verses, variously
    garbled but mostly made into an editorial, or a news dispatch with a
    Washington date-line but usually no date, were published all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span> over
    the country as evidence of Mr. Hearst’s complicity in the crime. As
    such they adorned the editorial columns of the New York <i>Sun</i> and
    blazed upon a bill-board in front of Tammany Hall. So fierce was the
    popular flame to which they were the main fuel that thousands of copies
    of the Hearst papers were torn from the hands of newsboys and burned
    in the streets. Much of their advertising was withdrawn from them.
    Emissaries of the <i>Sun</i> overran the entire country persuading
    clubs, libraries and other patriotic bodies to exclude them from the
    files. There was even an attempt made to induce Czolgosz to testify
    that he had been incited to his crime by reading them—ten thousand
    dollars for his family to be his reward; but this cheerful scheme was
    blocked by the trial judge, who had been informed of it. During all
    this carnival of sin I lay ill in Washington, unaware of it; and my
    name, although appended to all that I wrote, including the verses, was
    not, I am told, once mentioned. As to Mr. Hearst, I dare say he first
    saw the lines when all this hullabaloo directed his attention to them.</p>

  <p>With the occurrences here related the incident was not exhausted. When
    Mr. Hearst was making his grotesque canvass for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span> the Governorship of
    New York the Roosevelt Administration sent Secretary Root into the
    state to beat him. This high-minded gentleman incorporated one of the
    garbled prose versions of my prophecy into his speeches with notable
    effect and great satisfaction to his conscience. Still, I am steadfast
    in the conviction that God sees him; and if any one thinks that Mr.
    Root will not go to the devil it must be the devil himself, in whom,
    doubtless, the wish is father to the thought.</p>

  <p>Hearst’s newspapers had always been so unjust that no injustice could
    be done to them, and had been incredibly rancorous toward McKinley, but
    no doubt it was my luckless prophecy that cost him tens of thousands of
    dollars and a growing political prestige. For anything that I know (or
    care) they may have cost him his election. I have never mentioned the
    matter to him, nor—and this is what I have been coming to—has he ever
    mentioned it to me. I fancy there must be a human side to a man like
    that, even if he is a mischievous demagogue.</p>

  <p>In matters of “industrial discontent” it has always been a standing
    order in the editorial offices of the Hearst newspapers to “take the
    side of the strikers”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span> without inquiry or delay. Until the great
    publicist was bitten by political ambition and began to figure as a
    crazy candidate for office not a word of warning or rebuke to murderous
    mobs ever appeared in any column of his papers, except my own. A
    typical instance of the falsification of news to serve a foul purpose
    may be cited here. In Pennsylvania, a ferocious mob of foreign miners
    armed with bludgeons marched upon the property of their employers,
    to destroy it, incidentally chasing out of their houses all the
    English-speaking residents along the way and clubbing all that they
    could catch. Arriving at the “works,” they were confronted by a squad
    of deputy marshals, and while engaged in murdering the sheriff, who
    had stepped forward to read the riot act, were fired on and a couple
    of dozen of them killed. Naturally, the deputy marshals were put on
    trial for their lives. Mr. Hearst sent my good friend Julius Chambers
    to report the court proceedings. Day after day he reported at great
    length the testimony (translated) of the saints and angels who had
    suffered the mischance “while peacefully parading on a public road.”
    Then Mr. Chambers was ordered away and not a word of testimony for the
    defence (all in English), ever appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span> in the paper. Instances of
    such fair-mindedness as this could be multiplied by the thousand, but
    all, I charitably trust, have been recorded Elsewhere in a more notable
    Book than mine.</p>

  <p>Never just, Mr. Hearst is always generous. He is not swift to redress
    a grievance of one of his employees against another, but he is likely
    to give the complainant a cottage, a steam launch, or a roll of bank
    notes, if that person happens to be the kind of man to accept it,
    and he commonly is. As to discharging anybody for inefficiency or
    dishonesty—no, indeed, not so long as there is a higher place for him.
    His notion of removal is promotion.</p>

  <p>He once really did dismiss a managing editor, but in a few months the
    fellow was back in his old place. I ventured to express surprise. “Oh,
    that’s all right,” Mr. Hearst explained. “I have a new understanding
    with him. He is to steal only small sums hereafter; the large ones are
    to come to me.”</p>

  <p>In that incident we observe two dominant features in his character—his
    indifference to money and his marvelous sense of humor. He who should
    apprehend danger to public property from Mr. Hearst’s elevation to high
    office would err. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span> money to which he is indifferent includes that
    of others, and he smiles at his own expense.</p>

  <p>If there is a capable working newspaper man in this country who has
    not, <i>malgre lui</i>, a kindly feeling for Mr. Hearst, he needs
    the light. I do not know how it is elsewhere, but in San Francisco
    and New York Mr. Hearst’s habit of having the cleverest (not, alas
    the most conscientious) obtainable men, no matter what he had to pay
    them, advanced the salaries of all such men more than fifty per cent.
    Possibly these have receded, and possibly the high average ability of
    his men has receded too—I don’t know; but indubitably he did get the
    brightest men.</p>

  <p>Some of them, I grieve to say, were imperfectly appreciative of their
    employer’s gentle sway. At one time on the <i>Examiner</i> it was
    customary, when a reporter had a disagreeable assignment, for him to go
    away for a few days, then return and plead intoxication. That excused
    him. They used to tell of one clever fellow in whose behalf this plea
    was entered while he was still absent from duty. An hour afterward Mr.
    Hearst met him and, seeing that he was cold sober, reproved him for
    deceit. On the scamp’s assurance that he had honestly intended <span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>to
    be drunk, but lacked the price, Mr. Hearst gave him enough money to
    re-establish his character for veracity and passed on.</p>

  <p>I fancy things have changed a bit now, and that Mr. Hearst has changed
    with them. He is older and graver, is no longer immune to ambition,
    and may have discovered that good-fellowship with his subordinates
    and gratification of his lone humor are not profitable in business
    and politics. Doubtless too, he has learned from observation of his
    entourage of sycophants and self-seekers that generosity and gratitude
    are virtues that have not a speaking acquaintance. It is worth
    something to learn that, and it costs something.</p>

  <p>With many amiable and alluring qualities, among which is, or used to
    be, a personal modesty amounting to bashfulness, the man has not a
    friend in the world. Nor does he merit one, for, either congenitally
    or by induced perversity, he is inaccessible to the conception of an
    unselfish attachment or a disinterested motive. Silent and smiling,
    he moves among men, the loneliest man. Nobody but God loves him and
    he knows it; and God’s love he values only in so far as he fancies
    that it may promote his amusing ambition to darken the door of the
    White House.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span> As to that, I think that he would be about the kind of
    President that the country—daft with democracy and sick with sin—is
    beginning to deserve.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">A LITTLE bit of romance has just transpired to relieve the monotony of
    our metropolitan life. Old Sam Choggins, whom the editor of this paper
    has so often publicly thrashed, has returned from Mud Springs with a
    young wife. He is said to be very fond of her, and the way he came to
    get her was this:</p>

  <p>Some time ago we courted her, but finding she was “on the make” we
    threw off on her after shooting her brother. She vowed revenge and
    promised to marry any man who would horse-whip us. This Sam agreed to
    undertake, and she married him on that promise.</p>

    by request. The cause of his death, as nearly as could be ascertained
    by a single physician—Dr. Duffer being too drunk to attend—was Whisky

  <p>There was considerable excitement in the street yesterday, owing to
    the arrival of Bust-Head Dave, formerly of this place, who came over
    from Pudding Springs. He was met at the hotel by Sheriff Knogg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span> who
    leaves a large family. Dave walked down to the bridge, and it reminded
    one of old times to see the people go away as he heaved in view, for
    he had made a threat (first published in this paper) to clean out the
    town. Before leaving the place Dave called at our office to settle for
    a year’s subscription (invariably in advance) and was informed through
    a chink in the logs, that he might leave his dust in the tin cup at the
    well. Dave is looking much larger than at his last visit, just previous
    to the funeral of Judge Dawson. He left for Injun Hill at five o’clock
    amidst a good deal of shooting at rather long range. There will be an
    election for Sheriff as soon as a stranger can be found who will accept
    the honor.—<i>Yankee Flat “Advertiser.”</i></p>

  <p>A painful accident occurred in Frog Gulch yesterday which has cast a
    good deal of gloom over a hitherto joyous community. Dan Spigger—or, as
    he was familiarly called, Murderer Dan—got drunk at his usual hour and,
    as is his custom, took down his gun and started after the fellow who
    went home with Dan’s girl the night before. He found him at breakfast
    with his wife and children. After dispersing them he started out to
    return, but, being weary, stumbled and broke his leg. Dr. Bill Croft
    found him in that condition and, having no wagon at hand to convey
    him to town, shot him to put him out of his misery. His loss is a
    Democratic gain. He seldom disagreed with any but Democrats and would

  <p>The old gray-headed party who lost his life last Friday at the jeweled
    hands of our wife deserves more than a passing notice at ours. He came
    to this city last summer and started a weekly Methodist prayer-meeting,
    but being warned by the police, who was formerly a Presbyterian, gave
    up the swindle. He afterward undertook to introduce Bibles and, it is
    said, on one occasion attempted to preach. This was a little too much
    and at our suggestion he was tarred and feathered.</p>

  <p>For a time this treatment seemed to work a reform, but the heart of a
    Methodist is above all things deceitful <span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>and desperately wicked: he
    was soon after caught in the very act of presenting a hymnbook to old
    Ben Spoffer’s youngest daughter, Ragged Moll. The vigilance committee
    <i>pro tem.</i> waited on him, when he was decently shot and left for
    dead, as was recorded in this paper, with an obituary notice for which
    we have never received a cent. Last Friday, however, he was discovered
    sneaking into the potato patch connected with this paper and our wife,
    God bless her! got an axe and finished him then and there.</p>

  <p>His name was John Bucknor and it is reported (we do not know with how
    much truth) that at one time there was an improper intimacy between
    him and the lady who despatched him. If so, we pity Sal.—<i>Coyote “Trapper.”</i></p>

  <p>Our readers may have noticed in yesterday’s issue an editorial article
    in which we charged Judge Black with having murdered his father,
    beaten his wife and stolen seven mules from Jo Gorman. The facts are
    substantially as stated, but somewhat different. The killing was done
    by a Dutchman named Moriarty and the bruises that we happened to see
    on the face of the Judge’s wife were caused by a fall, she being,
    doubtless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span> drunk at the time. The mules had only strayed into the
    mountains and have returned all right.</p>

  <p>We consider the Judge’s anger at so trifling an error very ridiculous
    and insulting and if he comes to town he will not come again. An
    independent press is not to be muzzled by any absurd old duffer with
    a crooked nose and a sister who is considerably more mother than
    wife. Not so long as we have our usual success in thinning out the

  <p class="drop-cap">A SOCIETY of which I am the proud and happy founder is the American
    League for the Circumvention of Bores. With a view to enlisting the
    reader’s interest and favor and obtaining his initiation fee, I beg
    leave to expound the ends and methods of the order.</p>

  <p>The League purposes to work within the law: Bores can be circumvented
    by killing; which may be called the circumvention direct; but for
    every Bore that is killed arises a swarm of Bores (reporters, lawyers,
    jurors, etc.) whom one is unable to kill. The League plan is humane,
    simple, ingenious and effective. It leaves the Bore alive, to suffer
    the lasting torments of his own esteem.</p>

  <p>The American League for the Circumvention of Bores has the customary
    machinery of grips, pass-words, signs, a goat, solemn ceremonials and
    mystic hoodooing; but for practical use it employs only the Signal of
    Eminent Distress, to preservation of the secret whereof members are
    bound by the most horrible oath known to the annals of juration. It is
    a law that any member duly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span> convicted in the secret tribunals of the
    League of failing promptly to respond to the Signal of Eminent Distress
    shall suffer evisceration through the nose.</p>

  <p>The plan works this way: I am, say, on a ferry-boat. Carelessly
    glancing about, I see—yes, it must have been—ah! again: the Signal
    of Eminent Distress! A Brother of the League is <i>in articulo
      mortis</i>—the demon hath him—the beak of the Bore is crimson in his
    heart! I go to the rescue, choosing, according to my judgment and tact,
    one of the Ten Thousand Forms of Benign Relief which I have memorized
    from the Ritual.</p>

  <p>“Ah, my dear fellow,” I perhaps say to the victim, whom I may never
    have seen before, “I have been looking all over the boat for you.
    I must have a word with you on a most important matter if your
    friend”—looking at the baffled Bore who has been talking into him—“will
    have the goodness to excuse you.”</p>

  <p>Possibly, though, I say to the signaling victim: “Sir, pardon me, but
    is not your name—?”</p>

  <p>“Jonesmith,” he replies, coldly; “may I ask—?” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

  <p>“Ah, yes; I hope you will not think me intrusive, but a gentleman on
    the lower deck, who says he is your uncle, has fallen and broken his
    neck.”</p>

  <p>As Mr. Jonesmith with a grateful look moves off, the Bore, full of
    solicitude, starts to follow for assistance and condolence. I lay my
    hand on his arm. “Pardon, sir; the physician prescribes absolute quiet:
    the splendor, charm and vivacity of your conversation would unduly
    excite the patient.”</p>

  <p>Before the wretch can round-up his faculties the Brother in Distress
    has escaped and I am walking away with the 368th Aspect of Superb
    Unconcern, as laid down in the Ritual.</p>

  <p>The League has been in existence in New York city for about six months.
    There is a younger branch at Hohokus, and another is forming at Podunk.
    I am the Supreme Imperial Inimitable, though every member has high rank
    and office. Applications for membership must be made personally to the
    Grand Dictatorial Caboodle, which will judge whether the applicant is
    himself a Bore.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">CANDID PUBLISHER.—Sir, I am proud to meet you. Your book is
    admirable; it is exquisitely touching and beautiful.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Reasonable Author.</span>—Your commendation is most pleasing to me. I
    was at no time in doubt of your favorable action in the matter.</p>

  <p>C. P.—You did not hear me out. Publication of a book entails a
    considerable expense.</p>

  <p>R. A.—Naturally.</p>

  <p>C. P.—The money does not always come back.</p>

  <p>R. A.—I have been so informed. Publishers sometimes accept work that is
    very bad literature.</p>

  <p>C. P.—Yes, we try to.</p>

  <p>R. A.—Try to? You cannot mean that you prefer such work.</p>

  <p>C. P.—We must publish what will sell. Do you read the most popular
    books of the year—the “best-selling” novels?—nearly all “best sellers”
    are novels.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

  <p>R. A.—God forbid! I sometimes look at them.</p>

  <p>C. P.—Do you ever find <i>one</i> that has any literary merit?</p>

  <p>R. A.—Certainly not. I did not expect my book to be popular, but hoped
    that it might have a steady and perhaps increasing sale and eventually
    become famous. You sometimes publish new editions of the great works in
    our language—“the English classics.” Do you lose money by them?</p>

  <p>C. P.—Not usually. They have had the advantage of generations of
    advertising by scholars and by critics whose words had weight in their
    time and have in ours. If your excellent book finds a publisher pretty
    soon and is kept going until the year 2100, we shall be glad to put it
    on our list. You see it is very simple: you have only to conform to the
    conditions of success.</p>

  <p>R. A.—I see. But are these the only conditions? Some great work
    succeeds in its author’s time—that of Tennyson, Thackeray, Dickens,
    Carlyle, and so forth, in England; and in America that of—m, er, huh.</p>

  <p>C. P.—Is it surely great work? The ink is hardly dry. The literary
    fashions determining its form and substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span> are still with us.
    Posterity will have to pass judgment upon it, which posterity will
    indubitably do without reference to our view of the matter. Then, if
    you and I happen to be in communication with this vale of tears we
    shall know if these noted authors were mining the great mother-lode of
    human interest, or, occasionally touching some of its dips, spurs and
    angles, taking out barren rock. It looks to us like a rich enough ore,
    but it is a long journey to where there is an assaying-plant capable of
    dealing with that particular product. When it is “heard from” we shall
    not be here. Those who mined it are gone already.</p>

  <p>R. A.—Then there can be no valuable contemporary criticism?</p>

  <p>C. P.—None that any one can know to be valuable.</p>

  <p>R. A.—And no man can live long enough to know if he is a good writer?</p>

  <p>C. P.—The trade of writing has that disadvantage.</p>

  <p>R. A.—We are getting a long way from business. Am I to understand that
    you reject my book because, as you say, “it is exquisitely touching and
    beautiful”? </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></p>

  <p>C. P.—You outline the painful situation with accuracy.</p>

  <p>R. A.—Well, I’ll be damned!</p>

  <p>C. P.—Sure!—if you find a sentimentalist who will publish your book. He
    will do the damning.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">“DO you believe that?” said Dr. Dutton, passing a newspaper across the
    table to Will Brady and taking needless pains to point out “that” with
    his thumb. Brady read the discredited paragraph. It was as follows:</p>

  <blockquote class="clear">
    <p>Mr. John Doane, of Peequeegan, Maine, has received seven hundred
      and fifty thousand dollars from the estate of an old man whom he
      protected from the abuse of a rowdy fifteen years ago, and whom
      he never afterward saw nor heard from. In the will the old man
      apologized for the smallness of the bequest, explaining that it was
      all that he had.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>“Believe it?” said Brady; “I know it to be true. I was myself the—”</p>

  <p>He paused to think.</p>

  <p>“Now, how the devil,” said Dutton, “can you ring yourself into
    <i>that</i> story? You are not John Doane, and you certainly are not
    the late old man.”
  </p>

  <p>“I was about to say,” resumed Brady, composedly, “that I was myself the
    legatee in a somewhat similar case. In the year—”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span></p>

  <p>“Waiter,” said Dutton, “bring me twelve cigars, three bottles of
    champagne and, at daylight, a cup of powerful coffee. When the fellows
    come in from the theater ask them not to come into this room—say
    there’s a man in here who is engaged in being murdered.”</p>

  <p>“In the year 1892,” Mr. Brady went on to say, “I was living in Peoria,
    Illinois. One night while walking along the railroad track just outside
    of town I saw a man making the most violent exertions to release
    himself from the 'frog’ of a switch, into which he had incautiously
    wedged the heel of his shoe. He was steaming with perspiration and
    the look of agony on his face was worth a long walk to see. You
    have probably seen such a look on the countenance of many a patient
    undergoing the operation of receiving your bill. The express train was
    due in two minutes, and we had not so much as a match to signal it
    with—the night was tar-dark.”</p>

  <p>“The look of agony, I suppose, shone by its own inherent light.”</p>

  <p>“The man was facing away from the approaching train—the thunder of
    which was now audible between his groans and cries. Just in the nick
    of time I stepped up to him and introducing myself <span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>begged pardon for
    the intrusion and suggested that he unlace his shoe and remove his foot
    from it, which he did. When the train had passed he thanked me and
    handed me his card. I have carried it with me ever since—here it is.”</p>

  <p>Taking out a bit of pasteboard he handed it across the table without
    looking at it. It read:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="smcap fright">Oopsie.</span><span class="smcap">Dearie</span>,—I could not come: I was watched. To-morrow—same
      time, at the <i>other</i> place.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Doctor read the card and quietly handed it back. The story
    proceeded:</p>

  <p>“A moment later the man had disappeared, but in a week or two I
    received a letter from him, dated at Chicago. He said he owed his life
    to me and should devote it to my service. Being childless, friendless
    and heretofore without an aim or ambition, he should pass the rest of
    his days in acquiring wealth, in order to testify his gratitude. It
    would be a labor of love to trace me wherever I might wander—I need not
    apprise him of my address, nor in any way bother myself about him. If I
    survived him I would be a very rich man.</p>

  <p>“Well, sir, you may believe it or not, but if there is any name which
    deserves to be held by me in high honor for truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span> and simple good
    faith it is the name of—”</p>

  <p>“Oopsie.”</p>

  <p>Mr. Brady was visibly affected. For a moment he was fitly comparable to
    nothing warmer and livelier than a snow bank under the bleak stars of a
    polar midnight. The Doctor toyed absently with the ash-holder. It was a
    supreme crisis. It passed.</p>

  <p>“That man died in 1901 and left me, by will, an estate valued at more
    than nine hundred thousand dollars. The will was properly probated and
    never contested.”</p>

  <p>“But, my dear fellow,” said Dutton, taking at last a genuine interest
    in the narrative, “you never told us—nobody has ever heard of this, and
    you certainly do not pass for a very rich man. Did you really get the
    property?”</p>

  <p>“Alas, no,” said Brady, with a solemn shake of the head, as he rose
    from the table and glanced at his watch. “It is true, just as I have
    told you—on my honor: the man left me that property and all was square,
    regular and legal, but I did not get a cent. The fact is, I died
    first.” </p>

    <h3 id="THE_WIZARD_OF_BUMBASSA">THE WIZARD OF BUMBASSA</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">MR. GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE, the air-brake man, did a cruel and needless
    thing in going out of his way to try to destroy humanity’s hope of
    being shot along the ground at a speed of one hundred miles an hour.
    There is no trouble, it appears, in building locomotives able to
    snatch a small village of us through space at the required speed;
    the difficulty lies in making, with sufficient promptness, those
    unschedulary stops necessitated by open switches, missing bridges,
    and various obstacles that industrial discontent is wont to grace
    the track withal. Even on a straight line—what the civil engineers
    find a pleasure in calling a tangent—the prosperous industrian at
    the throttle-valve cannot reasonably be expected to discern these
    hindrances at a greater distance than one thousand feet; and Mr.
    Westinghouse sadly confessed that in that distance his most effective
    appliance could not do more than reduce the rate from one hundred miles
    an hour to fifty—an obviously inadequate reduction. He held out no hope
    of being able to evolve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span> from his inner consciousness either a brake of
    superior effectiveness or a pair of spectacles that would enable the
    engine driver to discover a more distant danger on a tangent, or to see
    round a curve.</p>

  <p>All this begets an intelligent dejection. If we must renounce our
    golden dream of cannonading ourselves from place to place with a
    celerity suitable to our rank in the world’s <i>fauna</i>—comprising
    the shark, the hummingbird, the hornet and the jackass
    rabbit—civilization is indeed a failure. But it is forbidden to
    the wicked pessimist to rejoice, for there is a greater than Mr.
    Westinghouse and he has demonstrated his ability to bring to a dead
    stop within its own length any railway train, however short and
    whatever its rate of speed. It were unwise though, to indulge too
    high a hope in this matter, even if the gloomy vaticinations of the
    Westinghouse person are fallacious. Approaching an evidence of social
    unrest at a speed of one and two-thirds mile a minute on a down grade,
    even in a train equipped by a greater than Mr. Westinghouse, may not be
    an altogether pleasing performance.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span></p>

  <p>This possibility can be best illustrated by recalling to the reader’s
    memory the history of the Ghargaroo and Gallywest Railway in Bumbassa.
    As is well known, the trains on that road attained a speed that had not
    theretofore been dreamed of except by the illustrious projector of the
    road. But the King of Bumbassa was not content: with an indifference
    to the laws of dynamics which in the retrospect seems almost imperial,
    he insisted upon instantaneous stoppage. To the royal demand the
    clever and prudent gentleman who had devised and carried out the
    enterprise responded with an invention which he assured his Majesty
    would accomplish the desired end. A trial was made in the sovereign’s
    presence, the coaches being loaded with his chief officers of state
    and other courtiers, and it was eminently successful. The train, going
    at a speed of ninety miles an hour, was brought to a dead stop within
    the length of the rhinoceros-catcher and directly in front of the blue
    cotton umbrella beneath which his Majesty sat to observe the result of
    the test. The passengers, unfortunately, did not stop so promptly, and
    were afterward scraped off the woodwork at the forward ends of the cars
    and decently interred. The train-hands had all escaped by the ingenious
    plan of absenting themselves from the proceedings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span> with the exception
    of the engineer, who had thoughtfully been selected for the occasion
    from among the relatives of the projector’s wife, and instructed how
    to shut off the steam and apply the brake. When hosed off the several
    parts of the engine he was found to have incurred a serious dispersal
    of the viscera.</p>

  <p>The King’s delight at the success of the experiment was somewhat
    mitigated by the reflection that if the train had been freighted with
    <i>bona fide</i> travelers instead of dignitaries whom he could replace
    by appointment the military resources of the state would have suffered
    a considerable loss; so he commanded the projector to invent a method
    of stopping the passengers and the trains simultaneously. This, after
    much experiment, was done by fixing the passengers to the seats by
    clamps extending across the abdomen and chest; but no provision being
    made for the head, a general decapitation ensued at each stop; and
    people who valued their heads preferred thereafter to travel afoot
    or ostrichback, as before. It was found, moreover, that, as arrested
    motion is converted into heat, the royal requirement frequently
    resulted in igniting and consuming the trains—which was expensive.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p>

  <p>These various hard conditions of railroading in Bumbassa eventually
    subdued the spirits of the stockholders, drove the projector to drink
    and led at last to withdrawal of the concession—whereby one of the most
    promising projects for civilizing the Dark Continent was, in the words
    of the Ghargaroo <i>Palladium</i> “knocked perfectly cold.”</p>

  <p>I have thought it well to recall this melancholy incident
    here for its general usefulness in pointing a moral, and for
    its particular application to the fascinating enterprise of a
    one-hundred-miles-an-hour electric road from New York to Chicago—a road
    whose trains, intending passengers are assured, will be under absolute
    control of the engineers and “can be stopped at a moment’s notice.”
    If I have said anything to discourage the enterprise I am sorry, but
    really it is not easy to understand why anybody should wish to go from
    New York to Chicago.</p>

  </div>

  <h4>I—<span class="smcap">The Dispersal</span></h4>

  <p class="drop-cap">SO sombre a phenomenon as the effacement of an ancient and brilliant
    civilization within the lifetime of a single generation is,
    fortunately, known to have occurred only once in the history of the
    world. The catastrophe is not only unique in history, but all the more
    notable for having befallen, not a single state overrun by powerful
    barbarians, but a half of the world; and for having been effected by
    a seemingly trivial agency that sprang from the civilization itself.
    Indeed, it was the work of one man.</p>

  <p>Hiram Perry (or Percy) Maximus was born in the latter part of the
    nineteenth century of “the Christian Era,” in Podunk, the capital of
    America. Little is known of his ancestry, although Dumbleshaw affirms
    on evidence not cited by him that he came of a family of pirates that
    infested the waters of Lake Erie (now the desert of Gobol) as early as
    “1813”—whenever that may have been.</p>

  <p>The precise nature of Hiram Perry’s invention, with its successive
    improvements, is not known—probably could not <span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>now be understood. It
    was called “the silent firearm”—so much we learn from fragmentary
    chronicles of the period; also that it was of so small size that
    it could be put into the “pocket.” (In his <i>Dictionary of
    Antiquities</i> the learned Pantin-Gwocx defines “pocket” as, first,
    “the main temple of the American deity;” second, “a small receptacle
    worn on the person.” The latter definition is the one, doubtless, that
    concerns us if the two things are not the same.) Regarding the work of
    “the silent firearm” we have light in abundance. Indeed, the entire
    history of the brief but bloody period between its invention and the
    extinction of the Christian civilization is an unbroken record of its
    fateful employment.</p>

  <p>Of course the immense armies of the time were at once supplied with
    the new weapon, with results that none had foreseen. Soldiers were
    thenceforth as formidable to their officers as to their enemies. It was
    no longer possible to maintain discipline, for no officer dared offend,
    by punishment or reprimand, one who could fatally retaliate as secretly
    and securely, in the repose of camp as in the tumult of battle. In
    civic affairs the deadly device was malignly active. Statesmen in
    disfavor (and all were hateful to men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span> of contrary politics) fell dead
    in the forum by means invisible and inaudible. Anarchy, discarding her
    noisy and imperfectly effective methods, gladly embraced the new and
    safe one.</p>

  <p>In other walks of life matters were no better. Armed with the sinister
    power of life and death, any evil-minded person (and most of the
    ancient Caucasians appear to have been evil-minded) could gratify a
    private revenge or wanton malevolence by slaying whom he would, and
    nothing cried aloud the lamentable deed.</p>

  <p>So horrible was the mortality, so futile all preventive legislation,
    that society was stricken with a universal panic. Cities were plundered
    and abandoned; villages without villagers fell to decay; homes were
    given up to bats and owls, and farms became jungles infested with wild
    beasts. The people fled to the mountains, the forests, the marshes,
    concealing themselves from one another in caves and thickets, and
    dying from privation and exposure and diseases more dreadful than the
    perils from which they had fled. When every human being distrusted and
    feared every other human being solitude was esteemed the only good; and
    solitude spells death. In one generation Americans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span> and Europeans had
    slunk back into the night of barbarism.</p>

  <h4>II—<span class="smcap">Rise and Fall of the Aeroplane</span></h4>

  <p>The craze for flying appears to have culminated in the year 369 Before
    Smith. In that year the aëroplane (a word of unknown derivation) was
    almost the sole means of travel. These flying-machines were so simple
    and cheap that one who had not a spare half-hour in which to make one
    could afford to purchase. The price for a one-man machine was about
    two dollars—one-tenth of a gooble. Double-seated ones were of course
    a little more costly. No other kinds were allowed by law, for, as was
    quaintly explained by a chronicle of the period, “a man has a right to
    break his own neck, and that of his wife, but not those of his children
    and friends.” It had been learned by experiment that for transportation
    of goods and for use in war the aëroplane was without utility. (Of
    balloons, dirigible and indirigible, we hear nothing after 348 B.
    S; the price of gas, controlled by a single corporation, made them impossible.)</p>

  <p>From extant fragments of Jobblecopper’s <i>History of Invention</i> it
    appears that in America alone there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span> at one time no fewer than ten
    million aëroplanes in use. In and about the great cities the air was so
    crowded with them and collisions resulting in falls were so frequent
    that prudent persons neither ventured to use them nor dared to go out
    of cover. As a poet of the time expressed it:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">With falling fools so thick the sky is filled</div>
        <div class="i0">That wise men walk abroad but to be killed.</div>
        <div class="i0">Small comfort that the fool, too, dies in falling,</div>
        <div class="i0">For he’d have starved betimes in any calling.</div>
        <div class="i0">The earth is spattered red with their remains:</div>
        <div class="i0">Blood, flesh, bone, gristle—everything but brains.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The reaction from this disagreeable state of affairs seems to have been
    brought about by a combination of causes.</p>

  <p>First, the fierce animosities engendered by the perils to pedestrians
    and “motorists”—a word of disputed meaning. So savage did this
    hostility become that firing at aëroplanes in flight, with the newly
    invented silent rifle, grew to the character of a national custom.
    Dimshouck has found authority for the statement that in a single
    day thirty-one aëronauts fell from the heavens into the streets of
    Nebraska, the capital of Chocago, victims of popular disfavor; and a
    writer of that time relates, not altogether lucidly, the finding in a
    park in Ohio of the bodies of “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span> Wright brothers, each pierced with
    bullets from hip to shoulder, the ears cut off, and without other marks
    of identification.”</p>

  <p>Second in importance of these adverse conditions was the natural
    disposition of the ancients to tire of whatever had engaged their
    enthusiasm—the fickleness that had led to abandonment of the bicycle,
    of republican government, of baseball, and of respect for women. In the
    instance of the aëroplane this reaction was probably somewhat hastened
    by the rifle practice mentioned.</p>

  <p>Third, invention of the electric leg. As a means of going from place to
    place the ancients had from the earliest ages of history relied largely
    on the wheel. Just how they applied it, not in stationary machinery,
    as we do ourselves, but as an aid to locomotion, we cannot now hope
    to know, for all the literature of the subject has perished; but it
    was evidently a crude and clumsy device, giving a speed of less than
    two hundred miles (four and a half sikliks) an hour, even on roadways
    specially provided with rails for its rapid revolution. We know, too,
    that wheels produced an intolerable jolting of the body, whereby
    many died of a disease known as “therapeutics.” Indeed, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>a certain
    class of persons who probably traveled faster than others came to be
    called “rough riders,” and for their sufferings were compensated by
    appointment to the most lucrative offices in the gift of the sovereign.
    Small wonder that the men of that day hailed the aëroplane with
    intemperate enthusiasm and used it with insupportable immoderation!</p>

  <p>But when the younger Eddy invented that supreme space-conquering
    device, the electric leg, and within six months perfected it to
    virtually what it is to-day, the necessity for flight no longer
    existed. The aëroplane, ending its brief and bloody reign a discredited
    and discarded toy, was “sent to the scrap-heap,” as one of our
    brightest and most original modern wits has expressed it. The wheel
    followed it into oblivion, whither the horse had preceded it, and
    Civilization lifted her virgin fires as a dawn in Eden, and like
    Cytherea leading her moonrise troop of nymphs and graces, literally
    legged it o’er the land!</p>

  <h4>III—<span class="smcap">An Ancient Hunter</span></h4>

  <p>In the nineteenth century of what, in honor of Christopher Columbum,
    a mythical hero, the ancients called the “Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span> era,” Africa was
    an unknown land of deserts, jungles, fierce wild beasts, and degraded
    savages. It is believed that no white man had ever penetrated it to a
    distance of one league from the coast. All the literature of that time
    relating to African exploration, conquest, and settlement is now known
    to be purely imaginative—what the ancients admired as “fiction” and we
    punish as felony.</p>

  <p>Authentic African history begins in the early years of the twentieth
    century of the “era” mentioned, and its most stupendous events are
    the first recorded, the record being made, chiefly, by the hand
    that wrought the work—that of Tudor Rosenfelt, the most illustrious
    figure of antiquity. Of this astonishing man’s parentage and early
    life nothing is certainly known: legend is loquacious, but history is
    silent. There are traditions affirming his connection with a disastrous
    explosion at Bronco, a city of the Chinese province of Wyo Ming, his
    subjugation of the usurper Tammano in the American city of N’yorx (now
    known to have had no existence outside the imagination of the poets)
    and his conquest of the island of Cubebs; but from all this bushel of
    fable we get no grain of authenticated fact. The tales appear to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
    merely hero-myths, such as belong to the legendary age of every people
    of the ancient world except the Greeks and Romans. Further than that
    he was an American Indian nothing can be positively affirmed of Tudor
    Rosenfelt before the year “1909” of the “Christian [Columbian] era.”
    In that year we glimpse him disembarking from two ships on the African
    coast near Bumbassa, and, with one foot in the sea and the other on dry
    land, swearing through clenched teeth that other forms of life than Man
    shall be no more. He then strides, unarmed and unattended, into the
    jungle, and is lost to view for ten years!</p>

  <p>Legend and myth now reassert their ancient reign. In that memorable
    decade, as we know from the ancient author of “Who’s Whoest in Africa,”
    the most incredible tales were told and believed by those who,
    knowing the man and his mission, suffered insupportable alternations
    of hope and despair. It was said that the Dark Continent into which
    he had vanished was frequently shaken from coast to coast as by the
    trampling and wrestling of titanic energies in combat and the fall of
    colossal bulks on the yielding crust of the earth; that mariners in
    adjacent waters heard recurrent growls <span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>and roars of rage and shouts
    of triumph—an enormous uproar that smote their ships like a gale from
    the land and swept them affrighted out to sea; that so loud were
    these terrible sounds as to be simultaneously audible in the Indian
    and Atlantic oceans, as was proved by comparing the logs of vessels
    arriving from both seas at the port of Berlin. As is quaintly related
    in one of these marine diaries, “The noise was so strenuous that our
    ears was nigh to busting with the wolume of the sound.” Through all
    this monstrous opulence of the primitive rhetorical figure known as the
    Lie we easily discern a nucleus of truth: something uncommon was going
    on in Africa.</p>

  <p>At the close of the memorable decade (<i>circa</i> “1919”) authentic
    history again appears in the fragmentary work of Antrolius: Rosenfelt
    walks out of the jungle at Mbongwa on the side of the continent
    opposite Bumbassa. He is now attended by a caravan of twenty thousand
    camels and ten thousand native porters, all bearing trophies of
    the chase. A complete list of these would require more pages than
    Homer Wheeler Wilcox’s catalogue of ships, but among them were
    heads of elephants with antlers attached; pelts of the checkered
    lion and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span> the spiny hippopotentot, respectively the most ferocious
    and the most venomous of their species; a skeleton of the missing
    lynx (<i>Pithecanthropos erectus compilatus</i>); entire bodies of
    pterodactyls and broncosauruses; a slithy tove mounted on a fine
    specimen of the weeping wanderoo; the downy electrical whacknasty
    (<i>Ananias flabbergastor</i>); the carnivorous mastodon; ten specimens
    of the skinless tiger (<i>Felis decorticata</i>); a saber-toothed
    python, whose bite produced the weeping sickness; three ribnosed
    gazzadoodles; a pair of blood-sweating bandicoots; a night-blooming
    jeewhillikins; three and a half varieties of the crested skynoceros; a
    purring crocodile, or buzz-saurian; two Stymphalian linnets; a skeleton
    of the three footed swammigolsis—afterwards catalogued at the Podunk
    Museum of Defective Types as <i>Talpa unopede noninvento</i>; a hydra
    from Lerna; the ring-tail mollycoddle and the fawning polecat (<i>Civis
      nondesiderabilis</i>).</p>

  <p>These terrible monsters, which from the dawning of time had ravaged
    all Africa, baffling every attempt at exploration and settlement,
    the Exterminator, as he came to be called, had strangled or captured
    with his bare hands; and the few remaining were so cowed that they
    gave milk.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span> Indeed, such was their terror of his red right arm that
    all forsook their evil ways, offered themselves as beasts of burden
    to the whites that came afterward, and in domestication and servitude
    sought the security that he denied to their ferocity and power. Within
    a single generation prosperous colonies of Caucasians sprang up all
    along the coasts, and the silk hat and pink shirt, immemorial pioneers
    and promoters of civilization, penetrated the remotest fastnesses,
    spreading peace and plenty o’er a smiling land!</p>

  <p>The later history of this remarkable man is clouded in obscurity.
    Much of his own account of his exploits, curiously intertangled with
    those of an earlier hero named Hercules, is extant, but it closes
    with his re-embarkation for America. Some hold that on returning to
    his native land he was assailed with opprobrium, loaded with chains,
    and cast into Chicago; others contend that he was enriched by gifts
    from the sovereigns of the world, received with acclamation by his
    grateful countrymen, and even mentioned for the presidency to succeed
    Samuel Gompers—an honor that he modestly declined on the ground of
    inexperience and unfitness. Whatever may be the truth of these matters,
    he doubtless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span> did not long suffer affliction nor enjoy prosperity, for
    in the great catastrophe of the year 254 B. S. the entire continent of
    North America and the contiguous island of Omaha were swallowed up by
    the sea. Fortunately his narrative is preserved in the Royal Library of
    Timbuktu, in which capital of civilization stands his colossal statue
    of ivory and gold. In the shadow of that renowned memorial I write this
    imperfect tribute to his worth.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WE all remember that the sound of a trumpet has been described as
    scarlet. The fact that we do remember it is evidence that the incident
    of a physical sensation masquerading in a garment appropriate to the
    guest of another sense than the one entertaining it is a general,
    not an individual, experience. Not, of course, that a trumpet-call
    impresses us all with a sense of color, but the odd description would
    long ago have been forgotten had not each mind recognized it as the
    statement of a fact belonging to a class of facts of which itself has
    had knowledge. For myself, I never hear good music without wishing
    to paint it—which I should certainly do with divine success if I
    understood music and could paint. The hackneyed and tiresome fashion
    of calling certain pictures “symphonies” in this or that color has
    a basis of reason—which will somewhat discredit it in the esteem of
    those whom it has enslaved. I never hear a man talking of “symphonies”
    in gray, green, pepper-and-salt, crushed banana, ashes-of-heretic or
    toper’s-nose without thinking with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span> satisfaction of the time when he
    will himself be a symphony in flame-color, lighting up the landscape
    of the underworld like a flamingo in the dun expanse of a marsh in the
    gloaming.</p>

  <p>I have in mind a notable instance of a sensation taking on three
    dimensions—one for which I am not indebted, probably, to the courtesy
    of some forgotten experience producing an association of ideas. It
    will be conceded that it is at least unlikely that one should ever
    enjoy simultaneously the double gratification of eating a pine-apple
    and seeing a man hanged; such felicity is reserved, I fancy, for
    creatures more meritorious than poor sinful human beings. Nevertheless,
    I never taste pine-apple without a lively sense of a man with his
    head in a black bag, depending from his beam. It is not that I am at
    the same time conscious of the fruit and of that solemn spectacle; it
    simply seems to me that a man hanging is the taste of that fruit. It
    is needless to add that when thinking of those unworthy persons, my
    enemies, I derive a holy delight from consuming generous slices of
    pine-apple.</p>

  <p>There is a class of mental phenomena which, so far as my knowledge
    goes, has never been “spread upon the record.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span> Possibly they are
    peculiar to my own imperfect understanding, and a saner consciousness
    is innocent of them. If so it will gratify my pride of monopoly to
    admit the public to a view of my intellectual chattels. The mental
    process of enumeration is with me a gliding upward in various
    directions from 1 to 100; not along a column of successive figures,
    like a cat scampering up a staircase, but along a smooth, pale-bluish,
    angular streak, with the hither-and-yon motion of a soaring snipe.
    From 1 to 10 the line runs upward, and to the right at an angle with
    the horizon of about sixty degrees. There it turns sharply back to the
    left and the grade to 20 is nearly flat. Thence to 30 the ascent is
    vertical. From 30 to 50 there is an ascent of 10 degrees to the right
    and slightly away from me. The course to 60 is to the left again, the
    angle, say 10 degrees. From 60 to 90 there is no break, the course,
    too, is almost level and directly away; thence to 100 nearly vertical.
    It will be observed that the angles are all at 10 and its multiples,
    but there is no angle at 40, none at 70, nor at 80. I may explain that
    the interval between 10 and 20 is greatly longer than it ought to be,
    and I venture to protest against the exceptional and unwarrantable
    brevity of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span> between 90 and 100.</p>

  <p>Every time I count I am compelled to ascend some part of this
    reasonless and ridiculous Jacob’s-ladder, with a “hitchety, hatchety,
    up I go” movement, like Jack mounting his bean-stalk; and it is
    ludicrously true that I feel a sense of relief on arriving at the more
    nearly level stages, and on them am conscious of an augmented speed.
    I can count from 60 to 70 twice as quickly as I can from 90 to 100.
    Investigation and comparison of such conceptions as these can but
    result in unspeakable advancement of knowledge. If any gentleman has
    similar ones and a little leisure for their discussion I hope he will
    consent to meet me in Heaven.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">MY death occurred on the 17th day of June, 1879—I shall never forget
    it. The day had been uncommonly hot, and the doctor kept telling me
    that unless it grew cooler he would hardly be able to pull me through.
    He said he was willing to do his best and prolong my life to the latest
    possible moment if I wished him to, but in any case I should have to
    die in a few days. I directed him to keep on prolonging, but the heat
    grew greater and finally overcame him, and I died. That is to say,
    while he was absent at an adjacent saloon after a sherry cobbler one
    of my “bad spells” came on and I fell a victim to inattention. Things
    turned out exactly as medical science had foretold.</p>

  <p>The funeral was largely attended and a society reporter was good enough
    to describe it as an “enjoyable occasion.” I had been a prominent
    member of one hundred and fifty societies, including the Sovereigns
    of Glory, the Confederated Idiots, Knights and Ladies of Indigence,
    Gorgeous Obsequies Guarantee Fraternity, Protective League of Adult
    Orphans, Ancient and Honorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span> Order of Divorced Men, Society for
    Converting Lawyers to Christianity, Murderers’ Mutual Resentment
    Association, League of Persons Having Moles on Their Necks, Brotherhood
    of Grand Flashing Inaccessibles, Mutual Pall Bearers, and Floral
    Tribute Consolation Guard. All these societies, and many more, were
    represented at my funeral, some in “regalia.” I was buried under more
    auspices than you could count. Soon after, I was ushered into the Other
    World.</p>

  <p>It is not like what you have been told, but I am forbidden to say what
    it is like. Suffice it that its inhabitants know all that goes on in
    the world we have left. Imagine, then, the delight with which I read
    in all the daily papers the various “resolutions of respect” adopted
    by the societies of which I had been a member. The Sovereigns of Glory
    said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Whereas</i>, Providence has found a pleasure in removing from
      among us His Majesty, Peter Wodel Mocump, our Order’s Serene
      Reigner over the Records; and</p>

    <p><i>Whereas</i>, Our royal hearts are deeply touched by this
      exercise of the divine prerogative;</p>

    <p><i>Resolved</i>, That in all the relations of life he was truly
      majestic and imperial.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span></p>

    <p>_Resolved_, That we tender our royal sympathy to his surviving
      Queen and the Princess and Princesses of his dynasty.</p>

    <p><i>Resolved</i>, That in testimony to his worth these resolutions be
      engrossed on parchment and publicly displayed for thirty days in the
      windows of a dry-goods shop.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Protective League of Adult Orphans held a meeting before I was
    cold, and passed the resolutions following:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Whereas</i>, The flower that bloomed under the name of Peter
      Wodel Mocump has been ruthlessly cut down by the Reaper whose name
      is Death; and</p>

    <p><i>Whereas</i>, He was a pansy; be it, therefore,</p>

    <p><i>Resolved</i>, That in his removal this League has lost a sturdy
      champion of the rights of orphans; and be it further</p>

    <p><i>Resolved</i>, That a general boycott be, and hereby is, declared
      against all orphans outside this Protective League.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Ancient and Honorable Order of Divorced Men eulogized me in the
    strongest language as one who had possessed in a high and conspicuous
    degree every qualification for membership in their Order. By the
    Murderers’ Mutual Resentment Association I was described as one whose
    time, talent and fortune were ever at the service of those injured in
    the world’s esteem by the judicial practice of alluding to the past.
    The League of Persons Having Moles on Their Necks said that, apart from
    the unusual size<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span> of my mole, I had ever shown a strong zeal for the
    public welfare and the advancement of civilization.</p>

  <p>I gathered up these various evidences of worth. I got together all the
    obituary notices from the newspapers, which showed with a singular
    unanimity that I was greatly addicted to secret almsgiving (how
    did they know it?) and that I was without a fault of character or
    disposition. I copied the inscription on my headstone and the verses
    in the death-column of the <i>Morning Buglehorn</i>—some of its death
    editor’s happiest and most striking lines. Altogether, this literature
    made a pretty large volume of eulogy. I had it printed and bound (in
    the Other World sense) and copiously indexed. It was the best reading I
    ever saw.</p>

  <p>The time arrived for me to appear at the gate of Heaven and make a
    personal demand for admission. I was notified of the hour when I would
    be heard, and was on hand. St. Peter received me with a smile and said:</p>

  <p>“We are full of business to-day; be brief and speak to the point.
    What do you know of yourself that entitles you to a seat in the blest abodes?” </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span></p>

  <p>I smiled rather loftily but without <i>hauteur</i>, and silently handed
    him the volume, bearing in golden letters on the cover the title: “My
    Record.” St. Peter turned over the leaves deliberately, read a passage
    here and there and handed it back, saying:</p>

  <p>“My friend, you have run into a streak of hard luck. The persons who
    have given you so good a character—the societies, newspapers, etc.—are
    unknown to me, and I don’t wish to say anything against them. But they
    have been backing a good many applicants lately, and I have let in a
    few on their judgment. Well, this very morning I got this note. I don’t
    mind letting you read it if you won’t say I showed it. You will see I
    can’t do anything for you.”</p>

  <p>He handed me a letter with about half the envelope torn off by careless
    opening. It read as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="smcap">Dear Peter</span>,—There has been quite a number of disturbances
      in here lately, and three or four cases of scandalous misconduct on
      the part of the saints, one of whom, in fact, eloped with an angel.
      Another was arrested for pocketing some of the golden pavement, and
      some have been trying to become famous by cutting their initials in
      the bark of the Tree of Life. Inquiry shows that in every instance
      the offender is a recent arrival, always a prominent citizen and a
      member of a number of “societies.” I won’t overrule<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span> your action,
      but really the character of this place is changing. I must ask you
      to stick to the old tests—a godly life and a humble acceptance of
      the Christian religion.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>When I saw the Name that was signed to that note I could not utter a
    word. I turned away and came Here.</p>

  <h4>I</h4>

  <p class="drop-cap">FOOL—I have a question for you.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Philosopher</span>—I have many, for myself. Do you happen to have
    heard that a fool can ask what a philosopher is unable to answer?</p>

  <p>F.—I happen to have heard that if that is true the one is as great a
    fool as the other.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—What presumption! Philosophy is search for truth; folly is
    submission to happiness.</p>

  <p>F.—But happiness is the sole desire and only possible purpose of man.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—Has virtue no other end?</p>

  <p>F.—The other end of virtue is the beginning.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—Instructed, I sit at your feet.</p>

  <p>F.—Unwilling to instruct, I stand on my head.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Philosopher</span>—You say that happiness is the sole desire of man.
    This is much disputed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—There is happiness in disputation.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—But Socrates says—</p>

  <p>F.—He was a Grecian. I hate foreigners.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—Wisdom is of no country.</p>

  <p>F.—Of none that I have observed.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Philosopher</span>—Let us return to our subject, happiness as the
    sole desire of man. Crack me these nuts. (1) The man that endures a
    life of toil and privation for the good of others.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—Does he feel remorse for so doing? Does he not rather
    like it?</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—(2) He who, famishing himself, gives his loaf to a beggar.</p>

  <p>F.—There are those who prefer benevolence to bread.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—(3) How of him who goes joyfully to martyrdom at the stake?</p>

  <p>F.—He goes joyfully.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—And yet—</p>

  <p>F.—Did you ever talk with a good man going to the stake?</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—I never saw one going to the stake.</p>

  <p>F.—Unfavored observer!—you were born a century too early.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Philosopher</span>—You say that you hate foreigners. Why?</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—Because I am human.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—But so are they.</p>

  <p>F.—I thank you for the better reason.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Philosopher</span>—I have been thinking of the pocopo.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—So have I; what is it?</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—The pocopo is a small Brazilian animal, chiefly remarkable
    for singularity of diet. A pocopo eats nothing but other pocopos. As
    these are not easily obtained, the annual mortality from starvation
    is very great. As a result, there are fewer mouths to feed, and by
    consequence the race is rapidly multiplying.</p>

  <p>F.—From whom had you this?</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—A professor of political economy.</p>

  <p>F.—Let us rise and uncover.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—A foreign student of the English language read the report
    of a colloquy between a fool and a philosopher. The remarks of the fool
    were indicated by the letter F; those of the philosopher by the letters
    <span class="smcap">Ph</span>—as ours will be if Heaven raise up a great, wise man to
    report them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Philosopher</span>—Well?</p>

  <p>F.—Nothing. Ever thereafter the misguided foreign student spelled
    “fool” with ph and philosopher with an f.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ph.</span>—Neo-Platonist!</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />
  <h4>II</h4>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—If I were a doctor—</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Doctor</span>—I should endeavor to be a fool.</p>

  <p>F.—You would fail—folly is not achieved, but upon the meritorious it is
    conferred.</p>

  <p>D.—For what purpose?</p>

  <p>F.—For yours.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—I have a friend who—</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Doctor</span>—Is in need of my assistance. Absence of excitement,
    absolute quiet, a hard bed and a simple diet; that will cure him.</p>

  <p>F.—Hardly. He is dead—he is taking your prescription.</p>

  <p>D.—All but the simple diet.</p>

  <p>F.—He is himself the diet.</p>

  <p>D.—How simple.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—What is the nastiest medicine?</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Doctor</span>—A fool’s advice.</p>

  <p>F.—And what the most satisfactory disease? </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>

  <p>D.—The most lingering one.</p>

  <p>F.—To the patient, I mean.</p>

  <p>D.—Paralysis of the thoracic duct.</p>

  <p>F.—I am not familiar with it.</p>

  <p>D.—It does not encourage familiarity. Paralysis of the thoracic duct
    enables the patient to overeat without taking the edge off his appetite.</p>

  <p>F.—What an admirable equipment for dining out! How long does the
    patient’s unnatural appetite last?</p>

  <p>D.—The time varies; always longer than he does.</p>

  <p>F.—As an hypothesis, that is imperfectly conceivable. It sounds like a
    doctrine.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Doctor</span>—Anything further?</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—You attend a patient; nevertheless he recovers. How do
    you tell if his recovery was because of your treatment or in spite of it?</p>

  <p>D.—I never do tell.</p>

  <p>F.—I mean, how do you know?</p>

  <p>D.—I take the opinion of a person interested in such matters: I ask a
    fool.</p>

  <p>F.—How does the patient know?</p>

  <p>D.—The fool asks me.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span></p>

  <p>F.—You are very kind; how shall I prove my ingratitude?</p>

  <p>D.—By close attention to the laws of health.</p>

  <p>F.—God forbid!</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />
  <h4>III</h4>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—Sir Cutthroat, how many orphans have you made to-day?</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Soldier</span>—The devil an orphan. Have you a family?</p>

  <p>F.—Put up your iron; I am the last of my race.</p>

  <p>S.—What!—no more fools?</p>

  <p>F.—Not one, so help me! They have all gone to the wars. By the way, you
    are somewhat indebted to me.</p>

  <p>S.—Let us arbitrate your claim: arbitration is good for my trade.</p>

  <p>F.—The only arbiter whose decision you respect is on your side. It
    hangs there.</p>

  <p>S.—It is impartial: it cuts both ways. For what am I indebted to you?</p>

  <p>F.—For existence. Prevalence of me has made you possible.</p>

  <p>S.—Possible? Sir, I am probable.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Soldier</span>—Why do you wear a cap and bells? </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—The civic equivalent of a helmet and plume.</p>

  <p>S.—Go “hang a calf-skin on those recreant limbs.”</p>

  <p>F.—’Tis only wisdom should be bound in calf, for wisdom is the veal of
    which folly is the matured beef.</p>

  <p>S.—Then folly should be garbed in cowskin.</p>

  <p>F.—Aye, that it may the sooner appear for what it is—the naked truth.</p>

  <p>S.—How should it?</p>

  <p>F.—You would soon strip off the hide to make harness and trappings
    withal. No one thinks what conquerors owe to cows.</p>

  <hr class="short mt2 mb2" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—Tell me, hero, what is strategy?</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Soldier</span>—The art of putting two knives to one throat.</p>

  <p>F.—And what is tactics?</p>

  <p>S.—The art of drawing them across it.</p>

  <p>F.—Fine! I read (in Joinville, I think) that during the Crusades the
    armament of a warship comprised two hundred serpents. These be strange
    weapons.</p>

  <p>S.—What stuff a fool may talk! The great Rameses used to turn loose
    lions against his enemies, but no true soldier would employ serpents.
    Those snakes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span> used by sailors.</p>

  <p>F.—A nice distinction, truly. Did you ever employ your blade in the
    splitting of hairs?</p>

  <p>S.—I have split masses of them!</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fool</span>—Speaking of the Crusades—at the siege of Acre, when a

  <p class="drop-cap">THE party given on Tuesday evening last at the residence of the Puffers
    was an enjoyable occasion. Next door to the residence is a church,
    and the festivities were frequently interrupted by an old-fashioned
    prayer meeting that was going on in the sacred edifice—the “amens” and
    “God-grant-its” being distinctly audible in the midst of the dance. The
    nuisance was finally abated by the police, but not until many of the
    guests had left the Puffer mansion in disgust.</p>

  <p>The week has been prolific of social gaieties. The hospitable mansions
    of the genteel, which were thrown shut during Lent, have been thrown
    open again, and all has gone merry as a married belle. The list
    of successful and long-to-be-remembered occasions is too long for
    publication and too important for abbreviation. It can only be said
    here, in a general way, that Society whooped it up great!</p>

  <p>The engagement is announced of Mr. Dreffeldude P. Milquesoppe to Miss
    Enameline Stuccup, the least-young daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span> of our distinguished
    townsman, Impyqu Stuccup, Esq., familiarly known as “the Golden
    Pauper.” The wedding is to take place as soon as the old man can sell
    his pigs.</p>

  <p>On Wednesday H. Grabberson Tump led to the altar Miss Toozifoozle Bilc,
    and having got her there, married her alive. The bridal presents were
    gorgeous, being the famous “Set No. 3” from the well and favorably
    known establishment of Pasticraft, Nickelgilt &amp; Co.—the same set that
    graced the showtable on the memorable occasion of the Whoopup-Hurroo
    nuptials last fall.</p>

  <p>The Society Editors’ League has purchased a new evening coat and
    appointed a committee to arrange a uniform vocabulary—a social
    Esperanto. The phrases, “palatial mansion,” “the hospitable doors
    were thrown open,” “the rank, beauty and fashion,” “the festivities
    were prolonged into the wee sma’ hours,” “Terpsichorean exercises
    were indulged in,” “the elegant collation was done ample justice to,”
    “joined in the holy bonds of wedlock,” will stand without revision.</p>

  <p>A fancy-dress ball was given by the inmates of the insanity asylum
    last Monday night. The only outmate present was the society editor of
    the <i>Technologist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></i>, who took the character of “The Lunatic,” and
    sustained it with such fidelity that he was a marked man. They marked
    him “3397” and kept him there.</p>

  <p>Our distinguished townsman, the Hon. Dollop Gobb, whose public-spirited
    investments in unimproved real estate have done so much to make this
    city what she is, was received everywhere with great consideration
    while in Europe. The brigands who captured him near Athens demanded
    the largest ransom for him that has ever been exacted for an American.
    When he ascended the Great Pyramid he was detained at the top until all
    that he had excepting his underclothing had gone as backsheesh to the
    downtrodden millions of Egypt. Innkeepers, couriers, guides, porters
    and servants vied with one another in paying homage to success in the
    person of this self-made American. Mr. Gobb believes that genuine worth
    is better appreciated under monarchical forms of Government than it is
    here.</p>

  <p>Mr. Joel Hamfat is reported engaged to Mrs. John Bamberson, whose
    husband is lying at the point of death. It is a genuine case of love at
    first sight, Mr. Hamfat being the head of the measuring department of
    the United Undertakers.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

  <p>On Monday, at the Church of St. Iniquity (Episcopalian), the Rev. Dr.
    Mammon Godder joined in the holy bonds of matrimony Jacob Abraham
    Isaacson, of the firm of Isaacson, Isaacson &amp; Isaacson, proprietors
    of the Seventh Commandment Bazaar, to Miss Rebekah Katzenstein,
    daughter of Aaron Levi Katzenstein, Esq., of Katzenstein, Abramson &amp;
    Lubeckheimer, gentlemen clothiers, No. 315 Little Kneedeep street.
    The wedding—including breakfast, wines, decorations, carriages and
    everything—cost more than a thousand dollars, but as the bride’s father
    felicitously remarked, “Monish is noddings ven it is a qvestion of
    doing somedings in a drooly Ghristian vay, don’t it?” It undoubtedly
    does.</p>

  <p>Old man Snoop has returned from Mud Springs much improved in age. His
    daughter, Mrs. Major and Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Straddleblind, has
    engaged lodging and board for him at the Alms House, where his private
    system of grammar will excite greater enthusiasm than it does at
    Humility Hill, as the charming villa of the Straddleblinds is called.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span></p>

  <p>The wedding of Miss Euphemia de Genlis Bullworthy-Clopsattle, the
    second charming daughter of our distinguished fellow citizen, the Hon.
    Aminadab Azrael Bullworthy Clopsattle, of “The Pollards,” to Jake
    Snoots will not take place at once; the bride-to-be will first be
    “confirmed.” She is wise—if anybody needs the consolation of religion
    she will.</p>

  <p>A reception in honor of the composer who wrote <i>Johnny, Get Your
      Gun</i> was held on Thursday evening last at the pal. man. of Mrs.
    Macpogram, who is herself a musician of no mean ability. The guest
    of the evening—whose name we do not at this moment recall—sang the
    composition which has made him famous from Maine to California.
    Afterward Miss Castoria Hamfat rendered <i>Yow che m’ rumpus</i> in
    excellent style, and Mr. —— (the gentleman who composed the other
    thing) was tickled half to death. We wish she had sung the whole opera.</p>

  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Whackup have returned from Europe, bringing many objects
    of art, some of which cost a great deal of money. Among them is
    Turner’s “Boy Eating an Apple,” of which the distinguished critic, Col.
    Twobottle, of Georgia, said that it would live as long as the language.
    Another treasure of the Whackup collection is Titian’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span> portrait of
    Mrs. Whackup’s aunt, painted by Signor Titian at one sitting. It is the
    intention to have the frame made of real ormolu and set with brilliants.</p>

  <p>The elegant entertainment last Tuesday evening at the palatial mansion
    of our distinguished townsman, J. Giles Noovoreesh Esq., was shorn of
    its intended proportions by the unexpected arrival of Mr. Noovoreesh
    himself. Some of the gentlemen who graced the occasion with their
    presence have not yet obtained their hats and overcoats. The scene
    that followed the irruption of Mr. N. into the grand hall where
    Terpsichorean festivities were eventuating is said by an eye-witness to
    have been the grandest spectacle since the retreat from Waterloo.</p>

  <p>A series of “Saturday morning <i>soirèes</i>” is announced at the
    suburban residence of Mrs. Judge of the Court of Acquittal Smythe.
    It is Mrs. Judge of the Court of Acquittal Symthe’s opinion that the
    uncommon hour will enable her to invite the persons whom she does not
    want, as well as the ladies and gentlemen whom she does.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lowt has had her ears pierced. It was done by the singing of her
    second daughter, Miss Loobie.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span></p>

  <p>From the list of persons whose presence added interest and charm to the
    splendid obsequies of the late Mrs. Bangupper, on Thursday last, we
    inadvertently omitted the name of the beautiful and accomplished Miss
    Chippie Hifli. She was lovely in a costume from Chicago, and divided
    honors with the remains.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Suds will give a literary entertainment at her residence on Angel
    avenue next Thursday evening, when her beautiful and gifted niece, Miss
    Simpergiggle, will read Poe’s Raven. She is an <i>élocutioniste</i>
    of remarkable powers, having twice received the highest honors in
    Professor’s Drumlung’s class and once driven an audience mad. Her
    rendering of <i>The Charge of the Light Brigade</i> is said to be
    unlike anything ever heard, and on one occasion it so fired the heart
    of a young man who was engaged to her that he instantly broke off the
    match, resolved to dedicate himself to the sword in the next war.</p>

  <p>One of the most enjoyable parties of the season was given on Thursday
    evening last by the hoodlumni of the little university around the
    corner. The guests comprised nearly all the gentlemen who have
    graduated during the past two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span> years.</p>

  <p>Miss Adiposa Brown wishes us to say that among those present at the
    Sucklebuster wedding we observed Miss Addie P. Brown, who looked
    enchanting in white silk and diamonds. We strive to please.</p>

  <p>Last Thursday’s post-mortem reception at the costly mansion of the
    Jonesmiths was a tasteful affair. The body of the hostess, in one of
    Grimdole &amp; Grewsums popular caskets, wore a magnificent moire-antique
    Mother Hubbard and a look of serene peace adorned with pearls. The
    coiffure was a triumph of the hair-dresser’s art. Too great praise
    cannot be given to the skill and artistic taste of Miss Nobbie Chic,
    under whose supervision the gorgeous apartments had been decorated with
    all manner of griefery: a skull-and-cross-bones in black spatter-work
    on a scarlet ground being particularly pleasing. The vegetable
    tributes, including a skeleton in orange blossoms, were mostly from the
    floral emporium of Jickster &amp; Gonkle. When the lid of the casket was
    screwed down there was noisier weeping than has ever been heard on any
    similar occasion in this city: the guests literally weltered in woe.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span></p>

  <p>Physicians declare that the apparently innocent habit of kissing lap
    dogs is a fruitful source of contagion. They point to the recent
    mortality among the dogs as confirmatory evidence.</p>

  <p>Last Wednesday evening’s reception at the Slumsprung residence was
    marred by the unexpected return of the old man. As it was understood
    that he was in Milpitas, and would not be invited anyhow, many of the
    guests had not taken the precaution to be armed, and for some time
    the festivities were one-sided. Luckily the tide was turned by the
    opportune arrival of Col. Spotshot. Silas Edward Slumsprung was born
    at Dawkinsville, Missouri, October 3, 1845. Educated as a blacksmith
    and fired with the spirit of adventure, he came to this state in 1870,
    since which time his fame is familiar to even the most lowly: no name
    has more prominently adorned the advertising columns of this journal
    than that of the distinguished remains. We mourn our loss.</p>

  <p>A successful party at Tarrytown—John D. Rockefeller.</p>

  <p>Among the most honored guests at the Hull-Caboodle reception last
    Thursday evening was Mr. Moriarty Monaghan, the distinguished inventor
    of the steam chaperon.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span></p>

  <p>At Mrs. Fastiddio’s <i>musicale</i> last Thursday evening the harmony
    of the occasion was somewhat marred by the sound of a desperate
    squabble in the entrance hall as Professor Schwackenheimer was singing
    his famous solo, <i>Dere’s moosic eferyvheres</i>. The fair hostess
    signified a wish that the festivities should not be suspended, but even
    beauty is unable to muzzle the press, and our reporter left the room
    to see what it was all about. The hall porter, whose hair and clothing
    were greatly deranged, explained with some excitement, between his
    gasps of fatigue, that he’d been “a firin’ out another one o’ them dam
    antecedents.”</p>

  <p>The Jacksprats are in Jebigue. They live there.</p>

  <p>The engagement is announced of Hunker Gowk to the widow Jonesmith,
    who will be remembered in connection with the road-house scandal of
    ten years ago. The engagement having revived public interest in that
    unfortunate episode in the life of the lady, it is related in full in
    another column.</p>

  <p>Our reporter was contumeliously treated at last Wednesday evening’s
    hoe-down at the Robinson mansion. This is the more surprising because
    the hostess is one of our oldest and most esteemed landmarks and is
    sincerely devoted to study of books <span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>on etiquette to make up for her
    early disadvantages. We forgive it as a mere <i>reversio ad naturam</i>.</p>

  <p>Miss Enameline Cartilagina Cmythe is visiting the mummy of Rameses II,
    in Cairo. They were schoolmates.</p>

  <p>They are telling (under the breath) of a clever thing which Mrs. Rooley
    said the other day. “My dear,” said an old schoolgirl friend whom she
    had not met since her marriage, “how could you venture to marry Mr.
    Rooley with that awful scandal hanging over you?” “The most natural
    thing in the world,” was the placid reply. “People were beginning to
    talk, and I married Mr. Rooley at once to keep him from hearing about
    it.”</p>

  <p>The Princess Bulli-Bulli is at the Golden Hotel. She will be remembered
    as the lady who kept the peanut parlors at 9276 Cobble street in the
    old days. Since she has got royal blood in her veins her Highness is,
    of course, somewhat haughty and cold in her manner, and has on two or
    three occasions inflicted severe injuries on the hotel servants; but
    she is at heart a true American lady and has six dogs.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Excrusia Blogg gave a party last Tuesday in celebration of her
    thirtieth birthday. Among the names of those not invited was that of
    the fair hostess’ daughter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span> Mrs. Rougeline Blogg-Dumperton, who with
    her five lovely children lives just over the way. The particulars of
    the estrangement are not known.</p>

  <p>In diamonds it is the fashion to have the breakfast sets entirely
    different from those worn at dinner. Nothing so conspicuously
    distinguishes the true lady as the jewelry she wears at breakfast. Mrs.
    Bluegore, the wife of the Hon. Asa Bluegore, M. C., is a model in this
    way; her diamonds always look as if she had slept in them, they are
    worn with so negligent a grace.</p>

  <p>At five-and-half o’clock teas it is <i>en règle</i> for the hostess to
    stir each cup of the beverage with her forefinger before administering
    it to the patient. This assures so low a temperature that the tea is
    retained in the system.</p>

  <p>Miss Exquisitia Multiboodle and father are registered at the Majestic
    hotel.</p>

  <p>The Tooquites, the Culcherfads and the Refinings are at the Divine.</p>

  <p>Old Mumchortle and his mahala are at the Squaremeal.</p>

  <p>There will be another <i>musicale</i> next Tuesday evening at the
    residence of Mrs. Jonas Goard. Professor Henrj Beerbellj will be
    present with his violin, and will play some choice selections from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
    Schopenhauer, Mazzini, Gambetta and Murillo. Mrs. Goard says it is her
    intention to make her weekly <i>musicales</i> the most peerless that
    money will collar.</p>

  <p>The Hiflungs are at the Splurge House. Their health has not been good
    since their return from Europe, Colonel Hiflung, Miss Hiflung, Miss
    Phlebotomy Hiflung and Masters Thanatopsis and Epithalamium Hiflung all
    suffering more or less acutely from brain failure.</p>

  <p>Gargoyle Squutney has arrived from Paris, where he had the distinction
    of ascending the Eiffel Tower. The Emperor paid him a great deal of
    attention and he met the Tuilleries.</p>

  <p>Society is justly indignant at the threatened publication of an
    <i>Èlite Directory</i> with an “Appendix of Antecedents.” Strenuous
    efforts at suppression have resulted in nothing, so far, but hopes are
    entertained of conciliating the author and publisher with an invitation
    to the Pursang luncheon next week. In the mean time that hardy and
    desperate man speaks of the ladies and gentlemen whom he weakly maligns
    in the columns of an infamous daily newspaper as “Our Sore Hundred.”

  <p>The new spring-style coffins have oxidized silver trimmings.</p>

  <p>Our distinguished townsman, the Hon. Mr. Col. Samuel Jiggs, Esquire, is
    understood to deprecate Society’s attitude toward him. He has confided
    to a prominent society man the fact that he is tired of attending his
    wife’s entertainments and hearing himself addressed by her guests as
    “Sam” and “Jiggsy.” He purposes, he says, to make certain radical
    improvements in the next galoots as allows they kin prosper withouten
    good manners.</p>

  <p>At the funeral of Miss Nobbie Skihi, last Thursday, the corpse was
    attired in a Directoire costume from Worth’s, and wore a diamond and
    sapphire necklace valued, according to the tag, at $15,000. In removing
    this at the close of the entertainment, the mother of the deceased was
    overcome with emotion, which found audible expression. The lady’s voice
    is a clear soprano of remarkable power.</p>

  <p>The Lalligaggs have taken rooms at the Hotel Paradise for the winter
    and the Mollicoddles for the storm. The Von Doodles are reported as
    storming at Hohokus.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span></p>

  <p>At the Rodaigent-Cadje wedding reception a new and admirable feature
    was introduced. On one end of a table were displayed the wedding
    presents, with the donor’s names attached. On the other end was a large
    number of wooden naughts, gilt and variously decorated. These bore
    the names of friends and acquaintances who gave nothing. It is said
    that some of the persons blacklisted have applied to the police for
    protection.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wollysnopple is in town again, where, being at present afflicted
    with smallpox, she has a wide circle of acquaintances.</p>

  <p>The beautiful and accomplished Miss Vaseline Upshoot damaged one of
    her toes last week in alighting from a street car. It was the sweetest
    little accident in the world, and the fair sufferer underwent a
    charming amputation.</p>

  <p>The Impycu family, who are at Gophertown, Hog Valley, wish us to state

  <p>Mrs. Breezy O’Blairney has offered the Academy of Sciences a
    magnificent oil portrait of her late husband, the Hon. Moriarty Fitz
    Flaherty O’Blairney. It is reported that the Academy is willing to

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span></p>

  <p>A pleasing incident in high life occurred the other evening at a
    <i>conversazione</i> given by Mrs. Fastidiana Rushereeeee, <i>nèe</i>
    Scroggins. The fair hands of the distinguished and wealthy hostess had
    worked in violets on a yellow ground the following chaste and elegant
    lines, which adorned one of the walls:
  </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">A gentleman of some literary pretensions from Boston enticed the
    hostess aside, and in the most cowardly manner intimated that she had
    erred in pronunciation, or else had a bad ear for rhyme. The insulted
    lady apprised the other gentlemen present of what had been said to
    her in her own house, and the fellow was energetically booted abroad,
    returning not any more to that place. And that is the pleasing incident
    above referred to.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Follyswaddle’s reception in honor of Lord 'Arry Chortle of Wapping

    Tollipoodleth now.</p>

  <p>The wake of Malone Finucain last Thursday night was marred by but a
    single untoward incident—the corpse got up and kicked everybody out
    of the house. The widow desires us to say that the second wake of the
    series will take place at a date not now determined, and each guest
    will be supplied at the door with an attested copy of a physician’s
    certificate of death.</p>

  <p>One of the most interesting souvenirs of royalty that this country can
    boast is in the possession of Miss Celeritie Hifli of this city. It
    was given to Miss Hifli by his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, who
    greatly admired her beauty. The souvenir is a Bank of England ten-pound
    note, which Miss Hifli has had framed and exhibits with pardonable
    pride. After the first few shocks, it is quite charming to observe her
    ingenuous way of speaking of his Royal Highness as “Al.”</p>

  <p>Society is discussing a shocking scandal. It is difficult to get the
    particulars from an authentic source, but they are believed to be
    about as follows: Three weeks ago, on the death of Miss R——, the body
    was placed in the handsome tomb of Colonel H——, an old friend of the
    family, the fine mausoleum of the R——s being incomplete.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span> The only
    occupant of the tomb when the body of Miss R—— was placed there was
    the remains of Colonel H——’s brother, but for the sake of propriety
    Mrs. X——, a friend of both families, had the mortal part of her
    mother conveyed there from another place. But on Tuesday last Mrs.
    X——, without notifying the R——s, had her mother’s body removed and
    sent East. From that day until yesterday the remains of Miss R—— were
    without a chaperon. Great indignation is felt against Mrs. X——, and it
    is thought that her action will seriously affect her social standing.</p>

  <h4 class="large"><span class="smcap">Rural</span></h4>

  <p>The festivities last Wednesday evening at the Turveypool mansion
    scooped the ranch. It was the slickest outfit of the season, and will
    shine in the annals of society worse than a new tin pan. The genial
    hostess was as affable as a candidate for coroner, and pitchforked her
    smiles about without caring a cuss where they struck and stuck. She’s
    the whitest woman in this social camp, and don’t you forget it.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Flyorbust gave a reception on Friday evening, which in point of
    pure elegance knocked everything perfectly cold and was a regular
    round-up of beauty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span> rank and fashion. The fair hostess’ long residence
    in the social centers of Europe, where she experted some of the
    niftiest occasions, has taught her how to do such things white. Among
    those present we observed Mr. Flyorbust, Miss Flyorbust, Miss Georgiana
    Glorinda Flyorbust, and Master Tom Busted.</p>

  <p>The engagement is announced of Mr. Megacephaloid Polliglot Paupertas,
    the distinguished and popular scion of the Munniglut stock, to a
    lady of acceptable fortune but humble birth, who is not at present
    in society and is therefore nameless in these columns. The wedding
    is expected to take place as soon as this person can dispose of some
    property in Hangtown. If the sale is auspiciously consummated the
    nuptials will eventuate with unscrupulous grandiosity.</p>

  <p>Society is unaffected by Lent: Mrs. Vulgaria de Binks-Browne says that
    she means to give a dizzy party next Wednesday evening and put on as
    much dog as anybody or bust a-trying. Those near to Mrs. Binks-Browne
    hope that she will succeed.</p>

  <p>We were honored yesterday by a call from the eminent statesman, the
    Hon. Braygong Bumble, and his distinguished dog. They remained an hour
    and left, going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span> in the direction of our loathsome contemporary, <i>The
      Squeege</i>. It is to be hoped they did not tarnish their respective
    escutcheons by calling on the presiding felon of that gang, and they
    probably did not, for the voice of fame has not pointed the finger of
    discovery at him.</p>

  <p>Old man Blivens wants the public to get onto the racket that his fat
    girl, Piggy Jane, is effectuating. As nearly as we could tumble to it
    from the elderly party’s prospectus, it is to be a lavender feed. The
    guests are not expected to eat that herb of the field, unless they want
    to, but its color will pervade the occasion like an undertone of garlic
    in a Dago Christmas. Ladies whose rinds don’t hitch well with lavender
    had better stay at home and go to the circus.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Colonel Pompinuppy’s Wednesday evenings will henceforth eventuate
    on Thursday afternoons. At the next one Signora Fahertini, a Dutch
    <i>cantatreechy</i>, will squawk up some classical music that will make
    the hair curl.

  <p>Pimply Johnson is pinching out at his Burro street shack. The medicine
    man has tooted his doom, but says he may possibly pull through the
    week. Keep your northwest eye open for an enjoyable funeral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span> if it
    is Christian weather. The remains will be <i>cached</i> in the natty
    mausoleum erected by them during life.</p>

  <p>The services last Sunday evening at the Church of the Holy Jones
    were enlivened by the presence of the beautiful Miss Marie Jeanne
    Hodj, who brandished the most paralyzing follyswaddles of any hen in
    the kaboodle. Her leading figleaf was of nun’s-unavailing, with a
    demi-train which responded rhythmically to every lateral impulse of
    her willowy figure. The rest of her outfit we didn’t slate. Miss Hodj
    looked sweet enough to eat!</p>

  <p>At the reception, last Tuesday evening, at the Loftinudle mansion, the
    many guests gracing the occasion with their presence were profoundly
    affected by the costliness and elegance of everything in the house and
    its appointments. No one thing knocked them silly, but there was a
    general allroundishness that laid ’em out like dead! It is universally
    admitted that the Loftinudle shack is uncommonly tough to tackle, and
    it is not thought that any of the shanties now going up in Smith’s
    Addition will be able to hold a candle to it. There are some persons,
    however, who expect old Loftinudle will himself hold a candle to it, as
    the insurance is significantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span> heavy.</p>

  <p>The Squuljees are now established in their new Malaria county villa,
    Skunkmead. The house, which is of the Renuisance style, is fitted with
    all the ancient and modern conveniences, and the whole place has been
    happily described by a reporter of the <i>Malarian</i> as strongly
    resembling Mr. Elysian’s fields. Mrs. Squuljee, Miss Squuljee and Miss
    Carameline Squuljee were in the city yesterday and were seen at a
    distance by our reporter. Unluckily they had seen him first.</p>

  <p>The Bachelor’s Club is madder than a wet cat. It was first flung to
    the breeze to enable the unmarried roosters to return-match the old
    hens who entertain them at the henneries; but the chaps do it so white
    that now the o. h.’s don’t put up at all. We plank down our in’ardest
    sympathy in the business, but that’s all we can do; owing to the
    death of a heavy advertiser the o. h. appertaining to our loathsome
    contemporary isn’t branching out into social gaieties much at the
    present writing.</p>

  <p>Mr. James O’Squander and Mrs. Jane McMillion are to be married next
    Hangman’s day—that day being selected in memory of the bridegroom’s
    sainted father. It was of this engagement that the Bard of Tar Flat,
    Ferd Anderson Snooks, penned his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span> brutal couplet, published by a
    disgusting contemporary:</p>

  <div class="center-container">

  <p>A Leap Year party was given on Monday evening at the Coyote District
    school-house, Potato county. The Temple of Science was beautifully
    decorated, the words “Leep Yeer,” tastily executed in colored chalks on
    the black-board, being conspicuously pleasing. They were the work of
    the teacher.</p>

  <p>The McCorkle crowd is Novembering at Iron Springs. That summer place
    of last resort does not advertise in this journal, but we know enough
    about it from other sources to whack up our deepest dollar on the
    proposition that the essence of latch-key which Mother Earth spits out
    at that place will knock the McCorkle livers galley west.</p>

    <h3 id="THE_EVOLUTION_OF_A_STORY">THE EVOLUTION OF A STORY</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ON a calm evening in the early summer, a young girl stood leaning
    carelessly against a donkey at the top of Plum Hill, daintily but with
    considerable skill destroying a biscuit by mastication’s artful aid.
    The sun had been for some time behind the sea, but the conscious West
    was still suffused with a faint ruddiness, like the reflection from an
    army of boiled lobsters marching below the horizon for a flank attack
    upon the stomach of Boston.</p>

  <p>Slowly and silently the ruby legion held its way. Not a word was
    spoken; commands given by the general were passed from mouth to
    mouth, like a single bit of chewing gum amongst the seven children
    immortalized by Edward Bok, who was more than usually active this
    evening, if that were possible.</p>

  <p>And it was possible; in no spirit of bravado, but with firm reliance on
    the <i>blanc mange</i> he had eaten for dinner, and which was even now
    shaping itself into exquisite fancies in the laboratory of his genius,
    the great editor had resolved to reach a higher excellence, or perish
    in the attempt, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span> tree frog, baffled by the smooth bark of the
    beech, falls exhausted into the spanning jaws of the serpent biding his
    time below.</p>

  <p>Having swallowed the frog, the reptile turned to go away, and by a
    sinuous course soon reached the highway. Here he stood up and looked
    about him. There was no living thing in sight. To the right hand and
    the left the dusty white road stretched away without a break in its
    dreary, mathematical sameness. Beyond a belt of pines on the opposite
    side rose a barren, rounded hilltop, resembling the bald crown of a
    game keeper thrust upward from behind a hedge to offer a shining mark
    for the poacher.</p>

  <p>Grimly the poacher raised and sighted his gun, charged with a double
    quantity of heavy slugs. There was a moment of silence—a silence so
    profound, so deathlike in its intensity, that a keen ear might have
    heard the spanking of an infant in a distant village.</p>

  <p>This infant had come, no one knew whence. The story went that it had
    tramped into town one cold morning, with its cradle slung across its
    back, and after being refused admittance to the hotel, had gone quietly
    to the back door and lain down, having first written and pinned to its
    gown the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span> following placard: “This unfortunate child is the natural
    son of a foreign prince, who until he shall succeed to the throne of
    his ancestors begs that the illustrious waif may be tenderly cared
    for. His Royal Highness cannot say how long his own worthless father
    may continue to disgrace the realm, but hopes not long. At the end of
    that time, his Royal Highness will appear to the child’s astonished
    benefactor, crusted as thickly with gems as a toad with warts.”</p>

  <p>These troublesome excrescences had given the poor toad much pain.
    Everything that science had devised, and skill applied, had been a mere
    waste of money; and now at the age of four hundred years, with life
    just opening before him, with other toads reveling about him in all the
    jump-up-and-come-down-hardness of their hearts he was compelled to drag
    himself nervelessly through existence, with no more hope of happiness
    than a piano has of marriage.</p>

  <p>It was not a nice piano; the keys were warped, the mainspring was
    relaxed, the cogwheels would not have anything to do with one another,
    and the pendulum would swing only one way. Altogether a disreputable
    and ridiculous old instrument. But such as it was, it had stood in
    that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span> dim old attic, man and boy, for more than thirty years. Its very
    infirmities, by exciting pity, had preserved it; not one of the family
    would have laid an axe at the root of that piano for as much gold as
    could be drawn by a team of the strongest horses.</p>

  <p>Of these rare and valuable animals we shall speak in our next chapter.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">“DOUBTLESS we have all great gratitude this night of Thanksgiving.
    Doubtless, too, we have ample cause and justification, for the dullest
    crack-brain of us all knows that life might have gone harder with
    him had the Power that compounds our joys and pains proportioned
    differently, to that end, the simples of the mixture.”</p>

  <p>So reading, I fell asleep, for I was full of bird. Straight appeared to
    me an angel, the dexter half of whom was white, the sinister, black—the
    line of division parting him from the hair down. Two skins of wine
    he bore; one wine was clear and sweet, and one was dark and bitter
    exceeding, such as would make a pig squeal. I saw, also, at his feet as
    he stood, some large glass vessels of even size, marked from bottom to
    top with a scale, the divisions numbered upward from 1 to 100.</p>

  <p>“Son of Mortality,” said he, “I am the Compounding Power—behold my
    standard mixture.” So saying he poured into one of the vessels 50 parts
    of sweet and the same of bitter. “This,” he <span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>said, “is without taste.
    It is for him whom Heaven doth neither bless nor afflict. There is but
    one such that liveth.”</p>

  <p>“The devil!” I cried, for indeed I greatly marveled that this should be
    so.</p>

  <p>Said the angel: “Guess again.”</p>

  <p>“Compound now, I beseech thee,” I said, “the best that thou hast use
    for in thy business: a tipple of surpassing richness—one which maketh
    the hair to curl.”</p>

  <p>Thereupon he put into the second vessel 1 part of bitter and 9 of
    sweet. And he looked upon it saying: “It is the best that it is
    permitted to me to do.”</p>

  <p>“Show me,” I said, “the worst; for truly it must be exceeding fierce,
    slaying at eighty rods.”</p>

  <p>“It is bad to take,” he answered, and straightway poured into the third
    vessel 10 parts of sweet. Then, upraising the other skin, he filled
    the vessel to the brim, and a great compassion fell upon my spirit,
    thinking on the unhappy man who should get himself outside that unholy
    tope.</p>

  <p>“Behold,” said the angel, “Heaven is just! The ratio of pain to joy in
    the lot of the happiest mortal is the same as that of joy to pain in
    his who is most wretched. It is 1 to 10.” And after some little time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
    he spake again:</p>

  <p>“I’m a dandy for fairness.”</p>

  <p>“True, O Dandy Allotter,” I said: “the proportions are only reversed.
    But these two vessels, the second and the third, holding the good
    draught and the bad—lo! the good is but a tenth part full, whilst the
    latter overfloweth the vessel. Is each quantity a dose?”</p>

  <p>And the angel said: “Each is a dose.”</p>

  <p>Wherefore I raised my voice against him, and called him out of his
    name, and cast my pillow upon him, and he departed out of that place
    with a loud cry. Then they that came in haste to my chamber, unbidden,
    looked one upon another and said: “He ate of the bird.” </p>

  <p class="drop-cap">GENDER is the sex of words. But either this matter of sex is
    imperfectly understood, or Nature has made faulty provision for the
    duality of things; for history and speech show many melancholy examples
    of natural celibacy, and Shelley’s dictum that “nothing in the world is
    single” must be accepted with the large limitation of a comprehensive
    denial. Who ever heard of an alligatrix? The spinster—has she anywhere
    a femaler mate, the spinstress? I am told there is an article, a
    garment, if I have rightly understood—called a garter, and that it has
    commonly a mate, yet I know not if any one has seen a gartress. Nor,
    for that matter, a garter. Has the cypress a lord and master known as
    the cypor? We hear of personal encounters, but a personal encounter
    between two ladies is not an encountress. Every one knows that an
    epistle is a female apostle, but why the male mate of the unlisted
    himmit should, except for consistency in perversion, be called a
    hermit, who can say? Oddly enough, the shero is unknown to fame. Is
    there a place beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span> the grave of the sinner, called Heol, and was its
    existence hinted at in the old name for Sheol? In Irish folklore is no
    mention of the banhee. An ornithologist of even the widest attainments
    will assure you that the queenfisher is an undiscovered fowl. Ancient
    history, sacred or profane, is vainly questioned concerning the King
    of Heba—whom nevertheless, I love to figure to myself as making a long
    journey to lay countless camel loads of gifts at the feet of the very
    wisest sovereign in all the world—the queen of the Shebrews.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">PERSONS who have not had the advantage of hearing about the Hon. Henry
    Vrooman in the past ten or twelve years will be surprised to learn that
    he is still living. The man has more lives than a ship-load of cats
    from Malta. In the past few years he has been dying of heart disease
    so fast that he is in danger of becoming extinct. His death-rate is
    appalling! He has died in every voting precinct in this part of the
    state, and his last words are about to be compiled in three volumes.
    Whenever Mr. Vrooman wants “the suffrages of his fellow-citizens” he
    gets them together in a hall, makes them a speech, assures them that
    his sands of life are pretty nearly run out, closes with some neat and
    appropriate patriotic sentiment suitable to the sad occasion, and then
    flops down and dies all over the floor. Just before the vital spark is
    extinct the meeting is adjourned by turning off the gas and the corpse
    is at liberty to rise and go home. The next morning Mr. Vrooman’s
    political organ relates how he was snatched from the jaws of death,
    though his condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span> is still critical; and the sovereign electors
    say: “Well, poor feller, he’s on his last legs anyway—guess it won’t
    do much harm to elect him.” The wretch never drew a cent of salary
    without committing the crime of obtaining money by false pretenses; he
    is always elected on the understanding that he is to die.</p>

  <p>But he doesn’t die—he is immortal. The moment that the “innumerable
    caravan” has passed the polling place he drops out of the procession
    and hangs about for his certificate of election. Then we hear no more
    about his poor heart until his term is about to expire, when it begins
    to trouble him again. He and his term generally manage to expire
    together in the sure and certain hope of a blessed resurrection.</p>

  <p>In the closing hours of the last session of the state senate somebody
    made a motion to limit all speeches to ten minutes. This brought Mr.
    Vrooman to his hind feet forthwith. “Mr. President,” he said, “standing
    as I do upon the threshold of the Unknown, and turning back to address
    my fellow-citizens for the last time, I feel grateful indeed that an
    all-wise Providence has so ordered it that my final words can be spoken
    in advocacy of the righteous and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span> beneficent principle of free speech,
    and in denunciation of the reptiles who would limit the liberty of
    debate. With a solemn sense of my responsibility to Him from whom I
    received my mental powers, and to whom I am so soon to give an account
    of my stewardship; gazing with a glazing eye upon the transitory scenes
    of earth, about which 'the dark Plutonian shadows gather on the evening
    blast’; conscious that the lute-string is about to snap and the pitcher
    to be broken at the well, I adjure you, friends of my former days, as
    in a whisper from the dark, not to let that motion prevail.”</p>

  <p>Wiping a light froth from his lips, the failing senator, with a friend
    under each arm and a half-dozen volunteer pall-bearers following,
    solemnly left the chamber to the sound of a dozen busy pens drafting
    resolutions of respect.</p>

  <p>A moment later Senator Moffitt walked into the hall, dexterously
    caught the presiding officer’s eye, and said: “Mr. President, it is
    my mournful duty to apprise this honorable body of my distinguished
    colleague’s continued existence. Born of poor but thoughtless parents
    and educated as a blacksmith; gifted with a penetrating intelligence
    which never failed in the darkest night to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>distinguish a five-dollar
    piece from a nickel, yet blessed with an impartial soul which loved
    the humbler coin as well, in proportion to its value, as the nobler
    one; blessed with a benevolence which relieved alike the rich man and
    the poor—the one of his coin, the other of his character; reared in
    the principles of religion and giving to the worship of himself an
    incredible devotion—this great man moved among the property of his
    neighbors, a living instance of the power of personal magnetism and
    the strength of political attachment. He was a generous man: one-half
    of all that he took with his right hand he bestowed upon his left. He
    was a respecter of Truth, and did not profane her with his lips. He
    was a patriot: other nations might be more powerful in arms, or more
    glorious in history, but America was good enough for him if he could
    get it. Withal, he had a tender heart acutely responsive to indigestion
    and closely identified with the political history of this state. Mr.
    President, I move that when the senate adjourn to go to luncheon it do
    so out of respect to the memory of Henry Vrooman. True, he is no deader
    than he was when he began to die ten years ago, but, sir, a memorial
    adjournment may have a deeper and better significance than is visible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
    in a mere conformity to fact: it may entoken a pious people’s readiness
    to submit to a tardy bereavement.”</p>

  <p>Senator Moffitt’s motion was peremptorily and contumeliously declared
    out of order, and that erring statesman dejectedly took his seat a
    sadder and a nicer man. It saddens to add that he solaced himself
    by consuming the public stationery in composing the following
    discreditable epitaph:</p>

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
